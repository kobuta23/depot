COUNCIL DECISION (EU) 2019/104

of 22 May 2018

on the position to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union, within the EU-Mexico Joint Council established under the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part, as regards the amendment of Decisions No 2/2000 and No 2/2001 of the Joint Council to take account of the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91, Article 100(2), Articles 207 and 211, in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

Whereas:

  

(1)

The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part [(1)](#ntr1-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0001) (the ‘Global Agreement’), was signed on 8 December 1997 and entered into force on 1 October 2000.

  

(2)

On 14 September 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the United Mexican States for the Third Additional Protocol to the Global Agreement to take account of the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union (the ‘Protocol’).

  

(3)

The negotiations were successfully concluded and in accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2018/2024 [(2)](#ntr2-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0002), the Protocol was signed on 27 November 2018.

  

(4)

Articles 5, 6, 7, 10 and 47 of the Global Agreement empower the EU-Mexico Joint Council established under Article 45 of the Global Agreement (the ‘Joint Council’) to take decisions aimed at attaining the Global Agreement's objectives, and in particular to decide on the appropriate arrangements and timetable for trade in goods, trade in services and public procurement.

  

(5)

Because Croatia is a Party to the Global Agreement, it is necessary to adapt several provisions of:

  

—

Decision No 2/2000 of the Joint Council [(3)](#ntr3-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0003), as amended by Decisions No 3/2004 [(4)](#ntr4-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0004) and No 2/2008 [(5)](#ntr5-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0005), concerning trade in goods, certification of origin and government procurement, and

  

—

Decision No 2/2001 [(6)](#ntr6-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0006), as amended by Decisions No 4/2004 [(7)](#ntr7-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0007) and No 3/2008 [(8)](#ntr8-L_2019021EN.01002301-E0008), to update the list of authorities responsible for financial services and those measures inconsistent with Articles 12 to 16 of Decision No 2/2001 that Croatia will maintain under Article 17(3) thereof.

  

(6)

The position of the Union within the Joint Council should therefore be based on the attached draft Decisions,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

Article 1

1.   The position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the EU-Mexico Joint Council established under the Global Agreement as regards the amendment of Decisions No 2/2000 and No 2/2001 of the Joint Council to take account of the accession of Croatia to the Union, shall be based on the draft Decisions of the Joint Council attached to this Decision.
