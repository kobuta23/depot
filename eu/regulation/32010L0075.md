DIRECTIVE 2010/75/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 24 November 2010

on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control)

(Recast)

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[ (1)](#ntr1-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0001),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[ (2)](#ntr2-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0002),

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure[ (3)](#ntr3-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0003),

Whereas:

  

(1)

A number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Directive 78/176/EEC of 20 February 1978 on waste from the titanium dioxide industry[ (4)](#ntr4-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0004), Council Directive 82/883/EEC of 3 December 1982 on procedures for the surveillance and monitoring of environments concerned by waste from the titanium dioxide industry[ (5)](#ntr5-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0005), Council Directive 92/112/EEC of 15 December 1992 on procedures for harmonising the programmes for the reduction and eventual elimination of pollution caused by waste from the titanium dioxide industry[ (6)](#ntr6-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0006), Council Directive 1999/13/EC of 11 March 1999 on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations[ (7)](#ntr7-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0007), Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste[ (8)](#ntr8-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0008), Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants[ (9)](#ntr9-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0009) and Directive 2008/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control[ (10)](#ntr10-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0010). In the interests of clarity, those Directives should be recast.

  

(2)

In order to prevent, reduce and as far as possible eliminate pollution arising from industrial activities in compliance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle and the principle of pollution prevention, it is necessary to establish a general framework for the control of the main industrial activities, giving priority to intervention at source, ensuring prudent management of natural resources and taking into account, when necessary, the economic situation and specific local characteristics of the place in which the industrial activity is taking place.

  

(3)

Different approaches to controlling emissions into air, water or soil separately may encourage the shifting of pollution from one environmental medium to another rather than protecting the environment as a whole. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide for an integrated approach to prevention and control of emissions into air, water and soil, to waste management, to energy efficiency and to accident prevention. Such an approach will also contribute to the achievement of a level playing field in the Union by aligning environmental performance requirements for industrial installations.

  

(4)

It is appropriate to revise the legislation relating to industrial installations in order to simplify and clarify the existing provisions, reduce unnecessary administrative burden and implement the conclusions of the Commission Communications of 21 September 2005 on the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution (hereinafter the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution), of 22 September 2006 on the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection and of 21 December 2005 on the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste adopted as a follow-up to Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme[ (11)](#ntr11-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0011). Those Communications set objectives to protect human health and the environment which cannot be met without further reductions in emissions arising from industrial activities.

  

(5)

In order to ensure the prevention and control of pollution, each installation should operate only if it holds a permit or, in the case of certain installations and activities using organic solvents, only if it holds a permit or is registered.

  

(6)

It is for Member States to determine the approach for assigning responsibilities to operators of installations provided that compliance with this Directive is ensured. Member States may choose to grant a permit to one responsible operator for each installation or to specify the responsibility amongst several operators of different parts of an installation. Where its current legal system provides for only one responsible operator for each installation, a Member State may decide to retain this system.

  

(7)

In order to facilitate the granting of permits, Member States should be able to set requirements for certain categories of installations in general binding rules.

  

(8)

It is important to prevent accidents and incidents and limit their consequences. Liability regarding the environmental consequences of accidents and incidents is a matter for relevant national law and, where applicable, other relevant Union law.

  

(9)

In order to avoid duplication of regulation, the permit for an installation covered by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community[ (12)](#ntr12-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0012) should not include an emission limit value for direct emissions of the greenhouse gases specified in Annex I to that Directive except where it is necessary to ensure that no significant local pollution is caused or where an installation is excluded from that scheme.

  

(10)

In accordance with Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), this Directive does not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures, for example greenhouse gas emission requirements, provided that such measures are compatible with the Treaties and the Commission has been notified.

  

(11)

Operators should submit permit applications containing the information necessary for the competent authority to set permit conditions. Operators should be able to use information resulting from the application of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment[ (13)](#ntr13-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0013) and of Council Directive 96/82/EC of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances[ (14)](#ntr14-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0014) when submitting permit applications.

  

(12)

The permit should include all the measures necessary to achieve a high level of protection of the environment as a whole and to ensure that the installation is operated in accordance with the general principles governing the basic obligations of the operator. The permit should also include emission limit values for polluting substances, or equivalent parameters or technical measures, appropriate requirements to protect the soil and groundwater and monitoring requirements. Permit conditions should be set on the basis of best available techniques.

  

(13)

In order to determine best available techniques and to limit imbalances in the Union as regards the level of emissions from industrial activities, reference documents for best available techniques (hereinafter BAT reference documents’) should be drawn up, reviewed and, where necessary, updated through an exchange of information with stakeholders and the key elements of BAT reference documents (hereinafter BAT conclusions’) adopted through committee procedure. In this respect, the Commission should, through committee procedure, establish guidance on the collection of data, on the elaboration of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance. BAT conclusions should be the reference for setting permit conditions. They can be supplemented by other sources. The Commission should aim to update BAT reference documents not later than 8 years after the publication of the previous version.

  

(14)

In order to ensure an effective and active exchange of information resulting in high-quality BAT reference documents, the Commission should establish a forum that functions in a transparent manner. Practical arrangements for the exchange of information and the accessibility of BAT reference documents should be laid down, in particular to ensure that Member States and stakeholders provide data of sufficient quality and quantity based on established guidance to enable the determination of best available techniques and emerging techniques.

  

(15)

It is important to provide sufficient flexibility to competent authorities to set emission limit values that ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. To this end, the competent authority may set emission limits that differ from the emission levels associated with the best available techniques in terms of the values, periods of time and reference conditions applied, so long as it can be demonstrated, through the results of emission monitoring, that emissions have not exceeded the emission levels associated with the best available techniques. Compliance with the emission limit values that are set in permits results in emissions below those emission limit values.

  

(16)

In order to take into account certain specific circumstances where the application of emission levels associated with the best available techniques would lead to disproportionately high costs compared to the environmental benefits, competent authorities should be able to set emission limit values deviating from those levels. Such deviations should be based on an assessment taking into account well-defined criteria. The emission limit values set out in this Directive should not be exceeded. In any event, no significant pollution should be caused and a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole should be achieved.

  

(17)

In order to enable operators to test emerging techniques which could provide for a higher general level of environmental protection, or at least the same level of environmental protection and higher cost savings than existing best available techniques, the competent authority should be able to grant temporary derogations from emission levels associated with the best available techniques.

  

(18)

Changes to an installation may give rise to higher levels of pollution. Operators should notify the competent authority of any planned change which might affect the environment. Substantial changes to installations which may have significant negative effects on human health or the environment should not be made without a permit granted in accordance with this Directive.

  

(19)

The spreading of manure contributes significantly to emissions of pollutants into air and water. With a view to meeting the objectives set out in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and Union law on water protection, it is necessary for the Commission to review the need to establish the most suitable controls of these emissions through the application of best available techniques.

  

(20)

The intensive rearing of poultry and cattle contributes significantly to emissions of pollutants into air and water. With a view to meeting the objectives set out in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and in Union law on water protection, it is necessary for the Commission to review the need to establish differentiated capacity thresholds for different poultry species in order to define the scope of this Directive and to review the need to establish the most suitable controls on emissions from cattle rearing installations.

  

(21)

In order to take account of developments in best available techniques or other changes to an installation, permit conditions should be reconsidered regularly and, where necessary, updated, in particular where new or updated BAT conclusions are adopted.

  

(22)

In specific cases where permit reconsideration and updating identifies that a longer period than 4 years after the publication of a decision on BAT conclusions might be needed to introduce new best available techniques, competent authorities may set a longer time period in permit conditions where this is justified on the basis of the criteria laid down in this Directive.

  

(23)

It is necessary to ensure that the operation of an installation does not lead to a deterioration of the quality of soil and groundwater. Permit conditions should, therefore, include appropriate measures to prevent emissions to soil and groundwater and regular surveillance of those measures to avoid leaks, spills, incidents or accidents occurring during the use of equipment and during storage. In order to detect possible soil and groundwater pollution at an early stage and, therefore, to take appropriate corrective measures before the pollution spreads, the monitoring of soil and groundwater for relevant hazardous substances is also necessary. When determining the frequency of monitoring, the type of prevention measures and the extent and occurrence of their surveillance may be considered.

  

(24)

In order to ensure that the operation of an installation does not deteriorate the quality of soil and groundwater, it is necessary to establish, through a baseline report, the state of soil and groundwater contamination. The baseline report should be a practical tool that permits, as far as possible, a quantified comparison between the state of the site described in that report and the state of the site upon definitive cessation of activities, in order to ascertain whether a significant increase in pollution of soil or groundwater has taken place. The baseline report should, therefore, contain information making use of existing data on soil and groundwater measurements and historical data related to past uses of the site.

  

(25)

In accordance with the polluter pays principle, when assessing the level of significance of the pollution of soil and groundwater caused by the operator which would trigger the obligation to return the site to the state described in the baseline report, Member States should take into account the permit conditions that have applied over the lifetime of the activity concerned, the pollution prevention measures adopted for the installation, and the relative increase in pollution compared to the contamination load identified in the baseline report. Liability regarding pollution not caused by the operator is a matter for relevant national law and, where applicable, other relevant Union law.

  

(26)

In order to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of this Directive, operators should regularly report to the competent authority on compliance with permit conditions. Member States should ensure that the operator and the competent authority each take necessary measures in the event of non-compliance with this Directive and provide for a system of environmental inspections. Member States should ensure that sufficient staff are available with the skills and qualifications needed to carry out those inspections effectively.

  

(27)

In accordance with the Århus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters[ (15)](#ntr15-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0015), effective public participation in decision-making is necessary to enable the public to express, and the decision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns which may be relevant to those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process and contributing to public awareness of environmental issues and support for the decisions taken. Members of the public concerned should have access to justice in order to contribute to the protection of the right to live in an environment which is adequate for personal health and well-being.

  

(28)

The combustion of fuel in installations with a total rated thermal input below 50 MW contributes significantly to emissions of pollutants into the air. With a view to meeting the objectives set out in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, it is necessary for the Commission to review the need to establish the most suitable controls on emissions from such installations. That review should take into account the specificities of combustion plants used in healthcare facilities, in particular with regard to their exceptional use in the case of emergencies.

  

(29)

Large combustion plants contribute greatly to emissions of polluting substances into the air resulting in a significant impact on human health and the environment. In order to reduce that impact and to work towards meeting the requirements of Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants[ (16)](#ntr16-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0016) and the objectives set out in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, it is necessary to set more stringent emission limit values at Union level for certain categories of combustion plants and pollutants.

  

(30)

The Commission should review the need to establish Union-wide emission limit values and to amend the emission limit values set out in Annex V for certain large combustion plants, taking into account the review and update of the relevant BAT reference documents. In this context, the Commission should consider the specificity of the energy systems of refineries.

  

(31)

Due to the characteristics of certain indigenous solid fuels, it is appropriate to apply minimum desulphurisation rates rather than emission limit values for sulphur dioxide for combustion plants firing such fuels. Moreover, as the specific characteristics of oil shale may not allow the application of the same sulphur abatement techniques or the achievement of the same desulphurisation efficiency as for other fuels, a slightly lower minimum desulphurisation rate for plants using this fuel is appropriate.

  

(32)

In the case of a sudden interruption in the supply of low-sulphur fuel or gas resulting from a serious shortage, the competent authority should be able to grant temporary derogations to allow emissions of the combustion plants concerned to exceed the emission limit values set out in this Directive.

  

(33)

The operator concerned should not operate a combustion plant for more than 24 hours after malfunctioning or breakdown of abatement equipment and unabated operation should not exceed 120 hours in a 12-month period in order to limit the negative effects of pollution on the environment. However, where there is an overriding need for energy supplies or it is necessary to avoid an overall increase of emissions resulting from the operation of another combustion plant, competent authorities should be able to grant a derogation from those time limits.

  

(34)

In order to ensure a high level of environmental and human health protection and to avoid transboundary movements of waste to plants operating at lower environmental standards, it is necessary to set and maintain stringent operating conditions, technical requirements and emission limit values for plants incinerating or co-incinerating waste within the Union.

  

(35)

The use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations gives rise to emissions of organic compounds into the air which contribute to the local and transboundary formation of photochemical oxidants which causes damage to natural resources and has harmful effects on human health. It is, therefore, necessary to take preventive action against the use of organic solvents and to establish a requirement to comply with emission limit values for organic compounds and appropriate operating conditions. Operators should be allowed to comply with the requirements of a reduction scheme instead of complying with the emission limit values set out in this Directive where other measures, such as the use of low-solvent or solvent-free products or techniques, provide alternative means of achieving equivalent emission reduction.

  

(36)

Installations producing titanium dioxide can give rise to significant pollution into air and water. In order to reduce these impacts, it is necessary to set at Union level more stringent emission limit values for certain polluting substances.

  

(37)

With regard to the inclusion in the scope of national laws, regulations and administrative provisions brought into force in order to comply with this Directive of installations for the manufacturing of ceramic products by firings, on the basis of the characteristics of the national industrial sector, and in order to grant clear interpretation of the scope, Member States should decide whether to apply both the criteria, production capacity and kiln capacity, or just one of the two criteria.

  

(38)

In order to simplify reporting and reduce unnecessary administrative burden, the Commission should identify methods to streamline the way in which data are made available pursuant to this Directive with the other requirements of Union law, and in particular Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register[ (17)](#ntr17-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0017).

  

(39)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for implementation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt guidance on the collection of data, on the drawing up of BAT reference documents and on their quality assurance, including the suitability of their content and format, to adopt decisions on BAT conclusions, to establish detailed rules on the determination of start-up and shut-down periods and for transitional national plans for large combustion plants, and to establish the type, format and frequency of information that Member States are to make available to the Commission. In accordance with Article 291 TFEU, rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for the control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers are to be laid down in advance by a regulation adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. Pending the adoption of that new regulation, Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[ (18)](#ntr18-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0018) continues to apply, with the exception of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, which is not applicable.

  

(40)

The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU in respect of the setting of the date from which continuous measurements of emissions into the air of heavy metals and dioxins and furans are to be carried out, and the adaptation of certain parts of Annexes V, VI and VII to scientific and technical progress. In the case of waste incineration plants and waste co-incineration plants, this may include, inter alia, the establishment of criteria to allow derogations from continuous monitoring of total dust emissions. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

  

(41)

In order to address significant environmental pollution, for example from heavy metals and dioxins and furans, the Commission should, based on an assessment of the implementation of the best available techniques by certain activities or of the impact of those activities on the environment as a whole, present proposals for Union-wide minimum requirements for emission limit values and for rules on monitoring and compliance.

  

(42)

Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

  

(43)

In order to provide existing installations with sufficient time to adapt technically to the new requirements of this Directive, some of the new requirements should apply to those installations after a fixed period from the date of application of this Directive. Combustion plants need sufficient time to install the necessary abatement measures to meet the emission limit values set out in Annex V.

  

(44)

Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of environmental quality, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the transboundary nature of pollution from industrial activities, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

  

(45)

This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to promote the application of Article 37 of that Charter.

  

(46)

The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive change as compared with the earlier Directives. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under the earlier Directives.

  

(47)

In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making[ (19)](#ntr19-L_2010334EN.01001701-E0019), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Union, their own tables, which will as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make those tables public.

  

(48)

This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex IX, Part B,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 29

Aggregation rules

1.   Where the waste gases of two or more separate combustion plants are discharged through a common stack, the combination formed by such plants shall be considered as a single combustion plant and their capacities added for the purpose of calculating the total rated thermal input.

2.   Where two or more separate combustion plants which have been granted a permit for the first time on or after 1 July 1987, or the operators of which have submitted a complete application for a permit on or after that date, are installed in such a way that, taking technical and economic factors into account, their waste gases could in the judgement of the competent authority, be discharged through a common stack, the combination formed by such plants shall be considered as a single combustion plant and their capacities added for the purpose of calculating the total rated thermal input.

3.   For the purpose of calculating the total rated thermal input of a combination of combustion plants referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, individual combustion plants with a rated thermal input below 15 MW shall not be considered.

Article 30

Emission limit values

1.   Waste gases from combustion plants shall be discharged in a controlled way by means of a stack, containing one or more flues, the height of which is calculated in such a way as to safeguard human health and the environment.

2.   All permits for installations containing combustion plants which have been granted a permit before 7 January 2013, or the operators of which have submitted a complete application for a permit before that date, provided that such plants are put into operation no later than 7 January 2014, shall include conditions ensuring that emissions into air from these plants do not exceed the emission limit values set out in Part 1 of Annex V.

All permits for installations containing combustion plants which had been granted an exemption as referred to in Article 4(4) of Directive 2001/80/EC and which are in operation after 1 January 2016, shall include conditions ensuring that emissions into the air from these plants do not exceed the emission limit values set out in Part 2 of Annex V.

3.   All permits for installations containing combustion plants not covered by paragraph 2 shall include conditions ensuring that emissions into the air from these plants do not exceed the emission limit values set out in Part 2 of Annex V.

4.   The emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex V as well as the minimum rates of desulphurisation set out in Part 5 of that Annex shall apply to the emissions of each common stack in relation to the total rated thermal input of the entire combustion plant. Where Annex V provides that emission limit values may be applied for a part of a combustion plant with a limited number of operating hours, those limit values shall apply to the emissions of that part of the plant, but shall be set in relation to the total rated thermal input of the entire combustion plant.

5.   The competent authority may grant a derogation for a maximum of 6 months from the obligation to comply with the emission limit values provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 for sulphur dioxide in respect of a combustion plant which to this end normally uses low-sulphur fuel, in cases where the operator is unable to comply with those limit values because of an interruption in the supply of low-sulphur fuel resulting from a serious shortage.

Member States shall immediately inform the Commission of any derogation granted under the first subparagraph.

6.   The competent authority may grant a derogation from the obligation to comply with the emission limit values provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 in cases where a combustion plant using only gaseous fuel has to resort exceptionally to the use of other fuels because of a sudden interruption in the supply of gas and for this reason would need to be equipped with a waste gas purification facility. The period for which such a derogation is granted shall not exceed 10 days except where there is an overriding need to maintain energy supplies.

The operator shall immediately inform the competent authority of each specific case referred to in the first subparagraph.

Member States shall inform the Commission immediately of any derogation granted under the first subparagraph.

7.   Where a combustion plant is extended, the emission limit values set out in Part 2 of Annex V shall apply to the extended part of the plant affected by the change and shall be set in relation to the total rated thermal input of the entire combustion plant. In the case of a change to a combustion plant, which may have consequences for the environment and which affects a part of the plant with a rated thermal input of 50 MW or more, the emission limit values as set out in Part 2 of Annex V shall apply to the part of the plant which has changed in relation to the total rated thermal input of the entire combustion plant.

8.   The emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex V shall not apply to the following combustion plants:

  

(a)

diesel engines;

  

(b)

recovery boilers within installations for the production of pulp.

9.   For the following combustion plants, on the basis of the best available techniques, the Commission shall review the need to establish Union-wide emission limit values and to amend the emission limit values set out in Annex V:

  

(a)

the combustion plants referred to in paragraph 8;

The Commission shall, by 31 December 2013, report the results of this review to the European Parliament and to the Council accompanied, if appropriate, by a legislative proposal.

Article 31

Desulphurisation rate

1.   For combustion plants firing indigenous solid fuel, which cannot comply with the emission limit values for sulphur dioxide referred to in Article 30(2) and (3) due to the characteristics of this fuel, Member States may apply instead the minimum rates of desulphurisation set out in Part 5 of Annex V, in accordance with the compliance rules set out in Part 6 of that Annex and with prior validation by the competent authority of the technical report referred to in Article 72(4)(a).

2.   For combustion plants firing indigenous solid fuel, which co-incinerate waste, and which cannot comply with the Cproc values for sulphur dioxide set out in points 3.1 or 3.2 of Part 4 of Annex VI due to the characteristics of the indigenous solid fuel, Member States may apply instead the minimum rates of desulphurisation set out in Part 5 of Annex V, in accordance with the compliance rules set out in Part 6 of that Annex. If Member States choose to apply this paragraph, Cwaste as referred to in point 1 of Part 4 of Annex VI shall be equal to 0 mg/Nm3.

3.   The Commission shall, by 31 December 2019, review the possibility of applying minimum rates of desulphurisation set out in Part 5 of Annex V, taking into account, in particular, the best available techniques and benefits obtained from reduced sulphur dioxide emissions.

Article 32

Transitional National Plan

1.   During the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2020, Member States may draw up and implement a transitional national plan covering combustion plants which were granted the first permit before 27 November 2002 or the operators of which had submitted a complete application for a permit before that date, provided that the plant was put into operation no later than 27 November 2003. For each of the combustion plants covered by the plan, the plan shall cover emissions of one or more of the following pollutants: nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and dust. For gas turbines, only nitrogen oxides emissions shall be covered by the plan.

The transitional national plan shall not include any of the following combustion plants:

  

(a)

those to which Article 33(1) applies;

  

(b)

those within refineries firing low calorific gases from the gasification of refinery residues or the distillation and conversion residues from the refining of crude oil for own consumption, alone or with other fuels;

  

(c)

those to which Article 35 applies;

  

(d)

those which are granted an exemption as referred to in Article 4(4) of Directive 2001/80/EC.

2.   Combustion plants covered by the plan may be exempted from compliance with the emission limit values referred to in Article 30(2) for the pollutants which are subject to the plan or, where applicable, with the rates of desulphurisation referred to in Article 31.

The emission limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust set out in the permit for the combustion plant applicable on 31 December 2015, pursuant in particular to the requirements of Directives 2001/80/EC and 2008/1/EC, shall at least be maintained.

Combustion plants with a total rated thermal input of more than 500 MW firing solid fuels, which were granted the first permit after 1 July 1987, shall comply with the emission limit values for nitrogen oxides set out in Part 1 of Annex V.

3.   For each of the pollutants it covers, the transitional national plan shall set a ceiling defining the maximum total annual emissions for all of the plants covered by the plan on the basis of each plant’s total rated thermal input on 31 December 2010, its actual annual operating hours and its fuel use, averaged over the last 10 years of operation up to and including 2010.

The ceiling for the year 2016 shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant emission limit values set out in Annexes III to VII to Directive 2001/80/EC or, where applicable, on the basis of the rates of desulphurisation set out in Annex III to Directive 2001/80/EC. In the case of gas turbines, the emission limit values for nitrogen oxides set out for such plants in Part B of Annex VI to Directive 2001/80/EC shall be used. The ceilings for the years 2019 and 2020 shall be calculated on the basis of the relevant emission limit values set out in Part 1 of Annex V to this Directive or, where applicable, the relevant rates of desulphurisation set out in Part 5 of Annex V to this Directive. The ceilings for the years 2017 and 2018 shall be set providing a linear decrease of the ceilings between 2016 and 2019.

Where a plant included in the transitional national plan is closed or no longer falls within the scope of Chapter III, this shall not result in an increase in total annual emissions from the remaining plants covered by the plan.

4.   The transitional national plan shall also contain provisions on monitoring and reporting that comply with the implementing rules established in accordance with Article 41(b), as well as the measures foreseen for each of the plants in order to ensure timely compliance with the emission limit values that will apply from 1 July 2020.

5.   Not later than 1 January 2013, Member States shall communicate their transitional national plans to the Commission.

The Commission shall evaluate the plans and, where the Commission has raised no objections within 12 months of receipt of a plan, the Member State concerned shall consider its plan to be accepted.

When the Commission considers a plan not to be in accordance with the implementing rules established in accordance with Article 41(b), it shall inform the Member State concerned that its plan cannot be accepted. In relation to the evaluation of a new version of a plan which a Member State communicates to the Commission, the time period referred to in the second subparagraph shall be 6 months.

6.   Member States shall inform the Commission of any subsequent changes to the plan.

Multi-fuel firing combustion plants

1.   In the case of a multi-fuel firing combustion plant involving the simultaneous use of two or more fuels, the competent authority shall set the emission limit values in accordance with the following steps:

  

(a)

taking the emission limit value relevant for each individual fuel and pollutant corresponding to the total rated thermal input of the entire combustion plant as set out in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex V;

  

(b)

determining fuel-weighted emission limit values, which are obtained by multiplying the individual emission limit value referred to in point (a) by the thermal input delivered by each fuel, and dividing the product of multiplication by the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels,

  

(c)

aggregating the fuel-weighted emission limit values.

2.   In the case of multi-fuel firing combustion plants covered by Article 30(2), which use the distillation and conversion residues from the refining of crude-oil for own consumption, alone or with other fuels, the following emission limit values may be applied instead of the emission limit values set according to paragraph 1:

  

(a)

where, during the operation of the combustion plant, the proportion contributed by the determinative fuel to the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels is 50 % or more, the emission limit value set in Part 1 of Annex V for the determinative fuel;

  

(b)

where the proportion contributed by the determinative fuel to the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels is less than 50 %, the emission limit value determined in accordance with the following steps:

  

(i)

taking the emission limit values set out in Part 1 of Annex V for each of the fuels used, corresponding to the total rated thermal input of the combustion plant;

  

(ii)

calculating the emission limit value of the determinative fuel by multiplying the emission limit value, determined for that fuel according to point (i), by a factor of two, and subtracting from this product the emission limit value of the fuel used with the lowest emission limit value as set out in Part 1 of Annex V, corresponding to the total rated thermal input of the combustion plant;

  

(iii)

determining the fuel-weighted emission limit value for each fuel used by multiplying the emission limit value determined under points (i) and (ii) by the thermal input of the fuel concerned and by dividing the product of this multiplication by the sum of the thermal inputs delivered by all fuels;

  

(iv)

aggregating the fuel-weighted emission limit values determined under point (iii).

3.   In the case of multi-fuel firing combustion plants covered by Article 30(2), which use the distillation and conversion residues from the refining of crude-oil for own consumption, alone or with other fuels, the average emission limit values for sulphur dioxide set out in Part 7 of Annex V may be applied instead of the emission limit values set according to paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article.

Article 41

CHAPTER IV

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR WASTE INCINERATION PLANTS AND WASTE CO-INCINERATION PLANTS

Article 42

Scope

1.   This Chapter shall apply to waste incineration plants and waste co-incineration plants which incinerate or co-incinerate solid or liquid waste.

This Chapter shall not apply to gasification or pyrolysis plants, if the gases resulting from this thermal treatment of waste are purified to such an extent that they are no longer a waste prior to their incineration and they can cause emissions no higher than those resulting from the burning of natural gas.

For the purposes of this Chapter, waste incineration plants and waste co-incineration plants shall include all incineration lines or co-incineration lines, waste reception, storage, on site pretreatment facilities, waste-, fuel- and air-supply systems, boilers, facilities for the treatment of waste gases, on-site facilities for treatment or storage of residues and waste water, stacks, devices and systems for controlling incineration or co-incineration operations, recording and monitoring incineration or co-incineration conditions.

If processes other than oxidation, such as pyrolysis, gasification or plasma process, are applied for the thermal treatment of waste, the waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant shall include both the thermal treatment process and the subsequent incineration process.

If waste co-incineration takes place in such a way that the main purpose of the plant is not the generation of energy or production of material products but rather the thermal treatment of waste, the plant shall be regarded as a waste incineration plant.

2.   This Chapter shall not apply to the following plants:

PART 3

Emission monitoring

1.   The concentrations of SO2, NOx and dust in waste gases from each combustion plant with a total rated thermal input of 100 MW or more shall be measured continuously.

The concentration of CO in waste gases from each combustion plant firing gaseous fuels with a total rated thermal input of 100 MW or more shall be measured continuously.

2.   The competent authority may decide not to require the continuous measurements referred to in point 1 in the following cases:

  

(a)

for combustion plants with a life span of less than 10 000 operational hours;

  

(b)

for SO2 and dust from combustion plants firing natural gas;

  

(c)

for SO2 from combustion plants firing oil with known sulphur content in cases where there is no waste gas desulphurisation equipment;

  

(d)

for SO2 from combustion plants firing biomass if the operator can prove that the SO2 emissions can under no circumstances be higher than the prescribed emission limit values.

3.   Where continuous measurements are not required, measurements of SO2, NOx, dust and, for gas fired plants, also of CO shall be required at least once every 6 months.

4.   For combustion plants firing coal or lignite, the emissions of total mercury shall be measured at least once per year.

5.   As an alternative to the measurements of SO2 and NOx referred to in point 3, other procedures, verified and approved by the competent authority, may be used to determine the SO2 and NOx emissions. Such procedures shall use relevant CEN standards or, if CEN standards are not available, ISO, national or other international standards which ensure the provision of data of an equivalent scientific quality.

6.   The competent authority shall be informed of significant changes in the type of fuel used or in the mode of operation of the plant. The competent authority shall decide whether the monitoring requirements laid down in points 1 to 4 are still adequate or require adaptation.

7.   The continuous measurements carried out in accordance with point 1 shall include the measurement of the oxygen content, temperature, pressure and water vapour content of the waste gases. The continuous measurement of the water vapour content of the waste gases shall not be necessary, provided that the sampled waste gas is dried before the emissions are analysed.

8.   Sampling and analysis of relevant polluting substances and measurements of process parameters as well as the quality assurance of automated measuring systems and the reference measurement methods to calibrate those systems shall be carried out in accordance with CEN standards. If CEN standards are not available, ISO, national or other international standards which ensure the provision of data of an equivalent scientific quality shall apply.

The automated measuring systems shall be subject to control by means of parallel measurements with the reference methods at least once per year.

The operator shall inform the competent authority about the results of the checking of the automated measuring systems.

9.   At the emission limit value level, the values of the 95 % confidence intervals of a single measured result shall not exceed the following percentages of the emission limit values:

  

Carbon monoxide

10 %

Sulphur dioxide

20 %

Nitrogen oxides

20 %

Dust

30 %

10.   The validated hourly and daily average values shall be determined from the measured valid hourly average values after having subtracted the value of the confidence interval specified in point 9.

Any day in which more than three hourly average values are invalid due to malfunction or maintenance of the automated measuring system shall be invalidated. If more than 10 days over a year are invalidated for such situations the competent authority shall require the operator to take adequate measures to improve the reliability of the automated measuring system.

11.   In the case of plants which must comply with the rates of desulphurisation referred to in Article 31, the sulphur content of the fuel which is fired in the combustion plant shall also be regularly monitored. The competent authorities shall be informed of substantial changes in the type of fuel used.

PART 4

Assessment of compliance with emission limit values

1.   In the case of continuous measurements, the emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2 shall be regarded as having been complied with if the evaluation of the measurement results indicates, for operating hours within a calendar year, that all of the following conditions have been met:

  

(a)

no validated monthly average value exceeds the relevant emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2;

  

(b)

no validated daily average value exceeds 110 % of the relevant emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2;

  

(c)

in cases of combustion plants composed only of boilers using coal with a total rated thermal input below 50 MW, no validated daily average value exceeds 150 % of the relevant emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2,

  

(d)

95 % of all the validated hourly average values over the year do not exceed 200 % of the relevant emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2.

The validated average values are determined as set out in point 10 of Part 3.

For the purpose of the calculation of the average emission values, the values measured during the periods referred to in Article 30(5) and (6) and Article 37 as well as during the start-up and shut-down periods shall be disregarded.

2.   Where continuous measurements are not required, the emission limit values set out in Parts 1 and 2 shall be regarded as having been complied with if the results of each of the series of measurements or of the other procedures defined and determined according to the rules laid down by the competent authorities do not exceed the emission limit values.

Vwaste

:

waste gas volume resulting from the incineration of waste only determined from the waste with the lowest calorific value specified in the permit and standardised at the conditions given by this Directive.

If the resulting heat release from the incineration of hazardous waste amounts to less than 10 % of the total heat released in the plant, Vwaste must be calculated from a (notional) quantity of waste that, being incinerated, would equal 10 % heat release, the total heat release being fixed.

Cwaste

Vproc

:

waste gas volume resulting from the plant process including the combustion of the authorised fuels normally used in the plant (wastes excluded) determined on the basis of oxygen contents at which the emissions must be standardised as set out in Union or national law. In the absence of legislation for this kind of plant, the real oxygen content in the waste gas without being thinned by addition of air unnecessary for the process must be used.

Cproc

:

emission limit values as set out in this Part for certain industrial activities or in case of the absence of such values, emission limit values of plants which comply with the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions for such plants while burning the normally authorised fuels (wastes excluded). In the absence of these measures the emission limit values set out in the permit are used. In the absence of such permit values the real mass concentrations are used.

C

:

total emission limit values at an oxygen content as set out in this Part for certain industrial activities and certain polluting substances or, in case of the absence of such values, total emission limit values replacing the emission limit values as set out in specific Annexes of this Directive. The total oxygen content to replace the oxygen content for the standardisation is calculated on the basis of the content above respecting the partial volumes.

All emission limit values shall be calculated at a temperature of 273,15 K, a pressure of 101,3 kPa and after correcting for the water vapour content of the waste gases.

Member States may lay down rules governing the exemptions provided for in this Part.

Monitoring of emissions

1.   Measurement techniques

1.1.   Measurements for the determination of concentrations of air and water polluting substances shall be carried out representatively.

1.2.   Sampling and analysis of all polluting substances including dioxins and furans as well as the quality assurance of automated measuring systems and the reference measurement methods to calibrate them shall be carried out according to CEN-standards. If CEN standards are not available, ISO, national or other international standards which ensure the provision of data of an equivalent scientific quality shall apply. Automated measuring systems shall be subject to control by means of parallel measurements with the reference methods at least once per year.

1.3.   At the daily emission limit value level, the values of the 95 % confidence intervals of a single measured result shall not exceed the following percentages of the emission limit values:

  

Carbon monoxide:

10 %

Sulphur dioxide:

20 %

Nitrogen dioxide:

20 %

Total dust:

30 %

Total organic carbon:

30 %

Hydrogen chloride:

40 %

Hydrogen fluoride:

40 %.

Periodic measurements of the emissions into air and water shall be carried out in accordance with points 1.1 and 1.2.

2.   Measurements relating to air polluting substances

2.1.   The following measurements relating to air polluting substances shall be carried out:

  

(a)

continuous measurements of the following substances: NOx, provided that emission limit values are set, CO, total dust, TOC, HCl, HF, SO2;

  

(b)

continuous measurements of the following process operation parameters: temperature near the inner wall or at another representative point of the combustion chamber as authorised by the competent authority, concentration of oxygen, pressure, temperature and water vapour content of the waste gas;

  

(c)

at least two measurements per year of heavy metals and dioxins and furans; one measurement at least every 3 months shall, however, be carried out for the first 12 months of operation.

2.2.   The residence time as well as the minimum temperature and the oxygen content of the waste gases shall be subject to appropriate verification, at least once when the waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant is brought into service and under the most unfavourable operating conditions anticipated.

2.3.   The continuous measurement of HF may be omitted if treatment stages for HCl are used which ensure that the emission limit value for HCl is not being exceeded. In that case the emissions of HF shall be subject to periodic measurements as laid down in point 2.1(c).

2.4.   The continuous measurement of the water vapour content shall not be required if the sampled waste gas is dried before the emissions are analysed.

2.5.   The competent authority may decide not to require continuous measurements for HCl, HF and SO2 in waste incineration plants or waste co-incineration plants and require periodic measurements as set out in point 2.1(c) or no measurements if the operator can prove that the emissions of those pollutants can under no circumstances be higher than the prescribed emission limit values.

The competent authority may decide not to require continuous measurements for NOx and require periodic measurements as set out in point 2.1(c) in existing waste incineration plants with a nominal capacity of less than 6 tonnes per hour or in existing waste co-incineration plants with a nominal capacity of less than 6 tonnes per hour if the operator can prove on the basis of information on the quality of the waste concerned, the technologies used and the results of the monitoring of emissions, that the emissions of NOx can under no circumstances be higher than the prescribed emission limit value.

2.6.   The competent authority may decide to require one measurement every 2 years for heavy metals and one measurement per year for dioxins and furans in the following cases:

  

(a)

the emissions resulting from co-incineration or incineration of waste are under all circumstances below 50 % of the emission limit values;

  

(b)

the waste to be co-incinerated or incinerated consists only of certain sorted combustible fractions of non-hazardous waste not suitable for recycling and presenting certain characteristics, and which is further specified on the basis of the assessment referred to in point (c);

  

(c)

the operator can prove on the basis of information on the quality of the waste concerned and the monitoring of the emissions that the emissions are under all circumstances significantly below the emission limit values for heavy metals and dioxins and furans.

2.7.   The results of the measurements shall be standardised using the standard oxygen concentrations mentioned in Part 3 or calculated according to Part 4 and by applying the formula given in Part 7.

When waste is incinerated or co-incinerated in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, the results of the measurements can be standardised at an oxygen content laid down by the competent authority reflecting the special circumstances of the individual case.

When the emissions of polluting substances are reduced by waste gas treatment in a waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant treating hazardous waste, the standardisation with respect to the oxygen contents provided for in the first subparagraph shall be done only if the oxygen content measured over the same period as for the polluting substance concerned exceeds the relevant standard oxygen content.

3.   Measurements relating to water polluting substances

3.1.   The following measurements shall be carried out at the point of waste water discharge:

  

(a)

(c)

at least monthly measurements of a flow proportional representative sample of the discharge over a period of 24 hours of Hg, Cd, TI, As, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn;

  

(d)

at least every 6 months measurements of dioxins and furans; however, one measurement at least every 3 months shall be carried out for the first 12 months of operation.

3.2.   Where the waste water from the cleaning of waste gases is treated on site collectively with other on-site sources of waste water, the operator shall take the measurements:

  

(a)

on the waste water stream from the waste gas cleaning processes prior to its input into the collective waste water treatment plant;

  

(b)

on the other waste water stream or streams prior to its or their input into the collective waste water treatment plant;

  

(c)

at the point of final waste water discharge, after the treatment, from the waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant.

1.   For emissions of the volatile organic compounds referred to in Article 58 where the mass flow of the sum of the compounds causing the labelling referred to in that Article is greater than, or equal to, 10 g/h, an emission limit value of 2 mg/Nm3 shall be complied with. The emission limit value refers to the mass sum of the individual compounds.

2.   For emissions of halogenated volatile organic compounds which are assigned or need to carry the hazard statements H341 or H351, where the mass flow of the sum of the compounds causing the hazard statements H341 or H351 is greater than, or equal to, 100 g/h, an emission limit value of 20 mg/Nm3 shall be complied with. The emission limit value refers to the mass sum of the individual compounds.

PART 5

Reduction scheme

1.   The operator may use any reduction scheme, specially designed for his installation.

2.   In the case of applying coatings, varnishes, adhesives or inks, the following scheme can be used. Where the following method is inappropriate, the competent authority may allow an operator to apply any alternative scheme achieving equivalent emission reductions to those achieved if the emission limit values of Parts 2 and 3 were to be applied. The design of the scheme shall take into account the following facts:

  

(a)

where substitutes containing little or no solvent are still under development, a time extension shall be given to the operator to implement his emission reduction plans;

  

(b)

the reference point for emission reductions should correspond as closely as possible to the emissions which would have resulted had no reduction action been taken.

3.   The following scheme shall operate for installations for which a constant solid content of product can be assumed:

  

(a)

The annual reference emission is calculated as follows:

  

(i)

The total mass of solids in the quantity of coating and/or ink, varnish or adhesive consumed in a year is determined. Solids are all materials in coatings, inks, varnishes and adhesives that become solid once the water or the volatile organic compounds are evaporated.

  

(ii)

The annual reference emissions are calculated by multiplying the mass determined in (i) by the appropriate factor listed in the table below. Competent authorities may adjust these factors for individual installations to reflect documented increased efficiency in the use of solids.

  

Activity

Multiplication factor for use in item (a)(ii)

Rotogravure printing; flexography printing; laminating as part of a printing activity; varnishing as part of a printing activity; wood coating; coating of textiles, fabric film or paper; adhesive coating

4

Coil coating, vehicle refinishing

3

Food contact coating, aerospace coatings

2,33

Other coatings and rotary screen printing

1,5

  

(b)

The target emission is equal to the annual reference emission multiplied by a percentage equal to:

  

(i)

(the fugitive emission limit value + 15), for installations falling within item 6 and the lower threshold band of items 8 and 10 of Part 2,

  

(ii)

(the fugitive emission limit value + 5) for all other installations.

  

(c)

Compliance is achieved if the actual solvent emission determined from the solvent management plan is less than or equal to the target emission.

PART 6

Emission monitoring

1.   Channels to which abatement equipment is connected, and which at the final point of discharge emit more than an average of 10 kg/h of total organic carbon, shall be monitored continuously for compliance.

2.   In the other cases, Member States shall ensure that either continuous or periodic measurements are carried out. For periodic measurements at least three measurement values shall be obtained during each measurement exercise.

3.   Measurements are not required in the case where end-of-pipe abatement equipment is not needed to comply with this Directive.

PART 7

Solvent management plan

1.   Principles

The solvent management plan shall be used to:

  

(a)

verify compliance as specified in Article 62;

  

(b)

identify future reduction options;

  

(c)

enable provision of information on solvent consumption, solvent emissions and compliance with the requirements of Chapter V to the public.

2.   Definitions

The following definitions provide a framework for the mass balance exercise.

Inputs of organic solvents (I):

  

I1

The quantity of organic solvents or their quantity in mixtures purchased which are used as input into the process in the time frame over which the mass balance is being calculated.

I2

The quantity of organic solvents or their quantity in mixtures recovered and reused as solvent input into the process. The recycled solvent is counted every time it is used to carry out the activity.

Outputs of organic solvents (O):

  

O1

Emissions in waste gases.

O2

Organic solvents lost in water, taking into account waste water treatment when calculating O5.

O3

The quantity of organic solvents which remains as contamination or residue in products output from the process.

O4

Uncaptured emissions of organic solvents into air. This includes the general ventilation of rooms, where air is released to the outside environment via windows, doors, vents and similar openings.

O5

Organic solvents and/or organic compounds lost due to chemical or physical reactions (including those which are destroyed, by incineration or other waste gas or waste water treatments, or captured, as long as they are not counted under O6, O7 or O8).

O6

Organic solvents contained in collected waste.

O7

Organic solvents, or organic solvents contained in mixtures, which are sold or are intended to be sold as a commercially valuable product.

O8

Organic solvents contained in mixtures recovered for reuse but not as input into the process, as long as not counted under O7.

O9

Organic solvents released in other ways.

3.   Use of the solvent management plan for verification of compliance.

The use made of the solvent management plan shall be determined by the particular requirement which is to be verified, as follows:

  

(a)

verification of compliance with the reduction scheme as set out in Part 5, with a total emission limit value expressed in solvent emissions per unit product, or otherwise stated in Parts 2 and 3.

  

(i)

for all activities using the reduction scheme as set out in Part 5, the solvent management plan shall be drawn up annually to determine the consumption (C). The consumption shall be calculated according to the following equation:

C = I1 – O8

A parallel exercise shall also be undertaken to determine solids used in coating in order to derive the annual reference emission and the target emission each year.

  

(ii)

for assessing compliance with a total emission limit value expressed in solvent emissions per unit product or otherwise stated in Parts 2 and 3, the solvent management plan shall be drawn up annually to determine the emissions (E). The emissions shall be calculated according to the following equation:

E = F + O1

Where F is the fugitive emission as defined in point (b)(i). The emission figure shall then be divided by the relevant product parameter.

  

(iii)

for assessing compliance with the requirements of point (b)(ii) of Article 59(6), the solvent management plan shall be drawn up annually to determine total emissions from all activities concerned, and that figure shall then be compared with the total emissions that would have resulted had the requirements of Parts 2, 3 and 5 been met for each activity separately.

  

(b)

Determination of fugitive emissions for comparison with the fugitive emission limit values in Part 2:

  

(i)

The fugitive emission shall be calculated according to one of the following equations;

F = I1 – O1 – O5 – O6 – O7 – O8

or

F = O2 + O3 + O4 + O9

F shall be determined either by direct measurement of the quantities or by an equivalent method or calculation, for instance by using the capture efficiency of the process.

The fugitive emission limit value is expressed as a proportion of the input, which shall be calculated according to the following equation:

I = I1 + I2

  

(ii)

Determination of fugitive emissions shall be done by a short but comprehensive set of measurements and needs not be done again until the equipment is modified.

PART 8

Assessment of compliance with emission limit values in waste gases

1.   In the case of continuous measurements the emission limit values shall be considered to be complied with if:

  

(a)

none of the arithmetic averages of all valid readings taken during any 24-hour period of operation of an installation or activity except start-up and shut-down operations and maintenance of equipment exceeds the emission limit values,

  

(b)

none of the hourly averages exceeds the emission limit values by more than a factor of 1,5.

2.   In the case of periodic measurements the emission limit values shall be considered to be complied with if, in one monitoring exercise:

  

(a)

the average of all the measurement values does not exceed the emission limit values,

  

(b)

none of the hourly averages exceeds the emission limit value by more than a factor of 1,5.

3.   Compliance with Part 4 shall be verified on the basis of the sum of the mass concentrations of the individual volatile organic compounds concerned. For all other cases, compliance shall be verified on the basis of the total mass of organic carbon emitted unless otherwise specified in Part 2.

4.   Gas volumes may be added to the waste gas for cooling or dilution purposes where technically justified but shall not be considered when determining the mass concentration of the pollutant in the waste gas.
