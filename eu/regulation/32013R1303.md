REGULATION (EU) No 1303/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 17 December 2013

laying down common provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

Having regard to the opinions of the European Economic and Social Committee[ (1)](#ntr1-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0001),

Having regard to the opinions of the Committee of the Regions[ (2)](#ntr2-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0002),

Having regard to the opinions of the Court of Auditors[ (3)](#ntr3-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0003),

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

Whereas:

  

(1)

Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, in order to strengthen its economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Union is to aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, and that particular attention is to be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps. Article 175 TFEU requires that the Union is to support the achievement of these objectives by the action it takes through the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guidance Section, the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Investment Bank and other instruments.

  

(2)

In order to improve coordination and harmonise implementation of the Funds providing support under cohesion policy, namely the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, with the Fund for rural development, namely the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and for the maritime and fisheries sector, namely measures financed under shared management in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), common provisions should be established for all these Funds (the 'European Structural and Investment Funds' - 'ESI Funds'). In addition this Regulation contains general provisions which apply to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund, but do not apply to the EAFRD and the EMFF as well as general provisions applicable to the ERDF, the ESF, the Cohesion Fund and the EMFF, but do not apply to the EAFRD. Due to the particularities that exist for each ESI Fund, specific rules applicable to each ESI Fund and to the European territorial cooperation goal under the ERDF should be specified in separate Regulations.

  

(3)

In line with the conclusions of the European Council of 17 June 2010, whereby the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth was adopted, the Union and Member States should implement the delivery of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, while promoting harmonious development of the Union and reducing regional disparities. The ESI Funds should play a significant role in the achievement of the objectives of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

  

(4)

As regards the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), significant synergies have already been obtained by harmonising and aligning management and control rules for the first pillar (European Agricultural Guarantee Fund - EAGF) and the second pillar (EAFRD) of the CAP. The strong link between the EAGF and the EAFRD should therefore be maintained and the structures already in place in the Member States preserved.

  

(5)

The outermost regions should benefit from specific measures and from additional funding to offset their structural social and economic situation together with the handicaps resulting from the factors referred to in Article 349 TFEU.

  

(6)

The northern sparsely populated regions should benefit from specific measures and additional funding to offset the severe and natural or demographic handicaps referred to in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.

  

(7)

To ensure the correct and consistent interpretation of provisions and to contribute to legal certainty for Member States and beneficiaries, it is necessary to define certain terms that are used in this Regulation.

  

(8)

Where a time limit is set for the Commission to adopt or amend a decision, in accordance with this Regulation, the time limit for the adoption or amendment of such a decision should not include the period starting on the date on which the Commission has sent its observations to the Member State and lasting until the Member State has responded to those observations.

  

(9)

This Regulation consists of five parts, of which the first sets out the subject-matter and definitions, the second contains rules applicable to all ESI Funds, the third includes provisions applicable only to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund (the 'Funds'), the fourth includes provisions applicable only to the Funds and to the EMFF and the fifth includes the final provisions. In order to ensure consistency in the interpretation of the different parts of this Regulation and between this Regulation and the Fund-specific Regulations, it is important to set out clearly the relationships between them. In addition, specific rules established in the Fund-specific rules can be complementary but should derogate from the corresponding provisions in this Regulation only where such derogation is specifically provided for in this Regulation.

  

(10)

Under Article 317 TFEU, and in the context of shared management, the conditions allowing the Commission to exercise its responsibilities for implementation of the budget of the Union should be specified and the responsibilities of cooperation with the Member States clarified. Those conditions should enable the Commission to obtain assurance that Member States are using the ESI Funds in a legal and regular manner and in accordance with the principle of sound financial management within the meaning of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (4)](#ntr4-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0004) (the 'Financial Regulation'). Member States at the appropriate territorial level, in accordance with their institutional, legal and financial framework and the bodies designated by them for that purpose should be responsible for preparing and implementing programmes. Those conditions should also ensure that attention is drawn to the need to ensure complementarity and consistency of relevant Union intervention, to respect the principle of proportionality and take into account the overall aim of reducing administrative burden.

  

(11)

For the Partnership Agreement and each programme respectively, each Member State should organise a partnership with the representatives of competent regional, local, urban and other public authorities, economic and social partners and other relevant bodies representing civil society, including environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and bodies responsible for promoting social inclusion, gender equality and non-discrimination, including, where appropriate, the umbrella organisations of such authorities and bodies. The purpose of such a partnership is to ensure respect for the principles of multi-level governance, and also of subsidiarity and proportionality and the specificities of the Member States' different institutional and legal frameworks as well as to ensure the ownership of planned interventions by stakeholders and build on the experience and the know-how of relevant actors. The Member States should identify the most representative relevant partners. Those partners should include institutions, organisations and groups which are capable of influencing the preparation or could be affected by the preparation and implementation of the programmes. In this context it should also be possible for Member States to identify, where appropriate, as relevant partners, umbrella organisations which are the associations, federations or confederations of relevant regional, local and urban authorities or other bodies in accordance with applicable national law and practices.

The Commission should be empowered to adopt a delegated act providing for a European code of conduct on partnership in order to support and facilitate Member States in the organisation of partnership with regard to ensuring the involvement of relevant partners in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Partnership Agreements and programmes in a consistent manner. That adopted delegated act should have under no circumstances and in no way of its interpretation retroactive effect or be the basis for establishing irregularities leading to financial corrections. The adopted delegated act should not specify a date of application that is earlier than the date of its adoption. The adopted delegated act should allow Member States to decide on the most appropriate detailed arrangements for implementing the partnership in accordance with their institutional and legal framework as well as their national and regional competences, provided that its objectives, as laid down in this Regulation, are achieved.

  

(12)

The activities of the ESI Funds and the operations which they support should comply with applicable Union and the related national law which directly or indirectly implements this Regulation and the Fund-specific rules.

  

(13)

In the context of its effort to increase economic, territorial and social cohesion, the Union should, at all stages of implementation of the ESI Funds, aim at eliminating inequalities and at promoting equality between men and women and integrating the gender perspective, as well as at combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), Article 10 TFEU and Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, taking into account in particular accessibility for persons with disabilities, as well as Article 5(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights stating that no one is to be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.

  

(14)

The objectives of the ESI Funds should be pursued in the framework of sustainable development and the Union's promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment as set out in Articles 11 and 191(1) TFEU, taking into account the polluter pays principle. To this end, the Member States should provide information on the support for climate change objectives, in line with the ambition to devote at least 20 % of the budget of the Union to those objectives, using a methodology based on the categories of intervention, focus areas or measures adopted by the Commission by means of an implementing act reflecting the principle of proportionality.

  

(15)

In order to contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and to the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, including economic, social and territorial cohesion, the ESI Funds should focus their support on a limited number of common thematic objectives. The precise scope of each of the ESI Funds should be set out in Fund-specific rules. It should be possible to limit that scope to only some of the thematic objectives defined in this Regulation.

  

(16)

In order to maximise the contribution of the ESI Funds and to establish strategic guiding principles to facilitate the programming process at the level of Member States and the regions, a Common Strategic Framework ('CSF') should be established. The CSF should facilitate the sectoral and territorial coordination of Union intervention under the ESI Funds and with other relevant Union policies and instruments, in line with the targets and objectives of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, taking into account the key territorial challenges of the various types of territories.

  

(17)

The CSF should set out how the ESI Funds are to contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the arrangements to promote an integrated use of the ESI Funds, the arrangements for coordination between the ESI Funds and other relevant Union policies and instruments, horizontal principles and cross-cutting policy objectives for the implementation of the ESI Funds, the arrangements to address key territorial challenges and priority areas for cooperation activities under the ESI Funds.

  

(18)

Member States and regions increasingly face challenges that relate to the impact of globalisation, environmental and energy concerns, population ageing and demographic shifts, technological transformation and innovation demands, and social inequality. Due to the complex and interrelated nature of such challenges, the solutions supported by the ESI Funds should be of an integrated nature, multi-sectoral and multi-dimensional. In this context, and in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the policies, it should be possible for the ESI Funds to be combined into integrated packages which are tailor-made to fit the specific territorial needs.

  

(19)

The combination of a shrinking working population and an increasing proportion of retired people in the general population as well as the problems associated with population dispersion, are expected to continue to place strains, inter alia, on Member States' education and social support structures and thus on the Union's economic competitiveness. Adapting to such demographic changes constitutes one of the core challenges that Member States and regions are to face in the years to come, and as such should be given a particularly high level of consideration for the regions most affected by demographic change.

  

(20)

On the basis of the CSF, each Member State should prepare, in cooperation with its partners, and in dialogue with the Commission, a Partnership Agreement. The Partnership Agreement should translate the elements set out in the CSF into the national context and set out firm commitments to the achievement of Union objectives through the programming of the ESI Funds. The Partnership Agreement should set out arrangements to ensure alignment with the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as well as with the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, arrangements to ensure effective and efficient implementation of the ESI Funds and arrangements for the partnership principle and an integrated approach to territorial development. A distinction should be made between the essential elements of the Partnership Agreement which are subject to a Commission decision and other elements which are not subject to the Commission decision and can be amended by the Member State. It is necessary to envisage specific arrangements for the submission and adoption of the Partnership Agreement and the programmes should the entry into force of one or more Fund-specific Regulations be delayed or be expected to be delayed. This entails establishing provisions which allow for the submission and adoption of the Partnership Agreement even in the absence of certain elements in relation to the ESI Fund or Funds affected by the delay, and the later submission of a revised Partnership Agreement after the entry into force of the delayed Fund-specific Regulation or Regulations. Since the programmes co-financed by the ESI Fund affected by the delay should in this case be submitted and adopted only after the entry into force of the Fund-specific Regulation concerned, appropriate deadlines for the submission of the affected programmes should also be laid down.

  

(21)

Member States should concentrate support to ensure a significant contribution to the achievement of Union objectives in line with their specific national and regional development needs. Ex ante conditionalities, as well as a concise and exhaustive set of objective criteria for their assessment, should be defined to ensure that the necessary prerequisites for the effective and efficient use of Union support are in place. To this end, an ex ante conditionality should apply to a priority of a given programme only when it has a direct and genuine link to, and a direct impact on, the effective and efficient achievement of a specific objective for an investment priority or a Union priority, given that not every specific objective is necessarily linked to an ex ante conditionality laid down in the Fund-specific rules. The assessment of applicability of an ex ante conditionality should take account of the principle of proportionality having regard to the level of support allocated, where appropriate. The fulfilment of the applicable ex ante conditionalities should be assessed by the Member State in the framework of its preparation of the programmes and, where appropriate, the Partnership Agreement. The Commission should assess the consistency and adequacy of the information provided by the Member State. In cases where there is a failure to fulfil an applicable ex ante conditionality within the deadline laid down, the Commission should have the power to suspend interim payments to the relevant priorities of the programme under precisely defined conditions.

  

(22)

The Commission should undertake a performance review based on a performance framework and in cooperation with the Member States, in 2019. The performance framework should be defined for each programme with a view to monitoring progress towards the objectives and targets set for each priority over the course of the 2014 - 2020 programming period (the 'programming period'). In order to ensure that the budget of the Union is not used in a wasteful or inefficient way, where there is evidence that a priority has seriously failed to achieve the milestones that relate only to financial indicators, output indicators and key implementation steps, set out in the performance framework, due to clearly identified implementation weaknesses previously communicated by the Commission, and the Member State has failed to take the necessary corrective action, the Commission should be able to suspend payments to the programme or, at the end of the programming period, to apply financial corrections. The application of financial corrections should take into account, with due respect for the principle of proportionality, the absorption level and external factors contributing to the failure. Financial corrections should not be applied where targets are not achieved because of the impact of socio-economic or environmental factors, significant changes in the economic or environmental conditions in a Member State or because of reasons of force majeure seriously affecting the implementation of the priorities concerned. Result indicators should not be taken into account for the purposes of suspensions or financial corrections.

  

(23)

In order to facilitate the focus on performance and attainment of the objectives of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, a performance reserve consisting of 6 % of the total allocation for the Investment for growth and jobs goal, as well as for the EARDF and for measures financed under shared management in accordance with a future Union legal act establishing the conditions for the financial support for maritime and fisheries policy for the 2014-2020 programming period (the 'EMFF Regulation'), should be established for each Member State. Due to their diversity and multi-country character, there should be no performance reserve for programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal. The resources allocated to the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) as defined in the operational programme in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (5)](#ntr5-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0005) (the 'ESF Regulation'); to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission; transfers from the first pillar of the CAP to the EAFRD under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (6)](#ntr6-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0006); transfers to the EAFRD pursuant to the provisions on voluntary adjustment of direct payments in 2013 and on transfers to the EAFRD, laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009[ (7)](#ntr7-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0007) in respect of calendar years 2013 and 2014; transfers to the Connecting Europe Facility from the Cohesion Fund; transfers to the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, as defined in a future Union legal act; and innovative actions for sustainable urban development should be excluded for the purpose of calculating the performance reserve.

  

(24)

A closer link between cohesion policy and the economic governance of the Union is needed in order to ensure that the effectiveness of expenditure under the ESI Funds is underpinned by sound economic policies and that the ESI Funds can, if necessary, be redirected to addressing the economic problems a Member State is facing. Under the first strand of measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance, the Commission should be able to request amendments to the Partnership Agreement and to the programmes in order to support the implementation of relevant Council recommendations or to maximise the growth and competitiveness impact of the available ESI Funds where Member States are receiving relevant financial assistance. Reprogramming should be used only in cases where it could indeed have a direct impact on the correction of the challenges identified in the relevant Council recommendations under the economic governance mechanisms in order to avoid frequent reprogramming which would disrupt fund management predictability. Under the second strand of measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance, where a Member State fails to take effective action in the context of the economic governance process, the Commission should make a proposal to the Council to suspend part or all of the commitments or payments for the programmes of that Member State. It is necessary to establish different procedures for the suspension of commitments and payments. Nevertheless, in both cases, when making a proposal for a suspension, the Commission should take into account all relevant information and give due consideration to any elements arising from, and opinions expressed through, the structured dialogue with the European Parliament.

The scope and level of a suspension should be proportionate and effective, and respect equality of treatment between Member States. Furthermore, a suspension should take into account the economic and social circumstances of the Member State concerned as well as the possible overall economic impact on a Member State resulting from the different steps of the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and excessive imbalances procedure (EIP).

  

(25)

By virtue of Protocol No 15 on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, certain provisions on the excessive deficit and related procedures are not to apply to the United Kingdom. Provisions on suspension of all or part of payments and commitments should therefore not apply to the United Kingdom.

  

(26)

Due to the paramount importance of the principle of co-financing for the implementation of the ESI Funds, in order to ensure the ownership of the policies on the ground, and in line with the proportional application of suspensions, any decisions on suspensions triggered under the second strand of measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance should be made taking into account the specific requirements applicable to the Member State concerned to provide co-financing for the programmes financed from the ESI Funds. The suspensions should be lifted and the funds made available again to the Member State concerned as soon as the Member State takes the necessary action.

  

(27)

The ESI Funds should be implemented through programmes covering the programming period in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Programmes should be drawn up by Member States based on procedures that are transparent, in accordance with their institutional and legal framework. Member States and the Commission should cooperate to ensure coordination and consistency of programming arrangements for the ESI Funds. As the content of programmes is closely interlinked with that of the Partnership Agreement, the programmes should be submitted within three months of the submission of the Partnership Agreement. A deadline of nine months from the date of entry into force of this Regulation should be provided for in relation to the submission of programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal in order to take into account the multi-country character of those programmes. In particular, a distinction should be made between the core elements of the Partnership Agreement and programmes which should be subject to a Commission decision and other elements which are not covered by the Commission decision and can be amended under the responsibility of the Member State. Programming should ensure consistency with the CSF and Partnership Agreement, coordination between the ESI Funds and with the other existing funding instruments and the input of the European Investment Bank if relevant.

  

(28)

With a view to ensuring consistency between programmes supported under different ESI Funds, particularly in the context of ensuring a contribution to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, it is necessary to set out common minimum requirements as regards the content of the programmes, which may be complemented by Fund-specific rules to take into account the specific nature of each ESI Fund.

  

(29)

It is necessary to lay down clear procedures for the assessment, adoption and amendment of programmes by the Commission. In order to ensure consistency between the Partnership Agreement and programmes, it should be specified that programmes, with the exception of programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal, cannot be approved before the adoption by the Commission of a decision approving the Partnership Agreement. To reduce the administrative burden on Member States, any approval of an amendment of certain parts of a programme by the Commission should result automatically in an amendment of the relevant parts of the Partnership Agreement. Furthermore, the immediate mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI should also be ensured by establishing special rules for the submission and the approval procedure of the dedicated operational programmes for the YEI referred to in the ESF Regulation.

  

(30)

In order to optimise the added value from investments funded wholly or in part through the budget of the Union in the field of research and innovation, synergies should be sought in particular between the operation of the ESI Funds and Horizon 2020, as set up in Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (8)](#ntr8-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0008), whilst respecting their distinct objectives. Key mechanisms for achieving those synergies should be the recognition of flat rates for eligible costs from Horizon 2020 for a similar operation and beneficiary and the possibility of combining funding from different Union instruments, including ESI Funds and Horizon 2020, in the same operation while avoiding double financing. In order to strengthen the research and innovation capacities of national and regional actors and to achieve the goal of building a "Stairway to excellence" in less developed regions and low-performing Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Member States and regions, close synergies should be developed between the ESI Funds and Horizon 2020 in all relevant programme priorities.

  

(31)

Territorial cohesion has been added to the goals of economic and social cohesion by the TFEU, and it is necessary to address the role of cities, functional geographies and sub-regional areas facing specific geographical or demographic problems. To this end, and to better mobilise potential at a local level, it is necessary to strengthen and facilitate community-led local development by laying down common rules and ensuring close coordination for all relevant ESI Funds. Community-led local development should take into account local needs and potential, as well as relevant socio-cultural characteristics. Responsibility for the design and implementation of community-led local development strategies should be given to local action groups representing the interests of the community, as an essential principle. The detailed arrangements concerning the definition of the area and population covered by the community-led local development strategies should be set out in the relevant programmes in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

  

(32)

In order to facilitate a manageable approach to its integration into the programming process, the community-led local development can be carried out under a single thematic objective, either to promote social inclusion and combat poverty, or to promote employment and labour mobility, notwithstanding that actions financed as part of community-led local development could contribute to all other thematic objectives.

  

(33)

Where an urban or territorial development strategy requires an integrated approach because it involves investments under more than one priority axis of one or more operational programmes, it should be possible for action supported by the Funds, that can be complemented with financial support from the EAFRD or the EMFF, to be carried out as an integrated territorial investment within an operational programme or programmes.

  

(34)

Financial instruments are increasingly important due to their leverage effect on the ESI Funds, their capacity to combine different forms of public and private resources to support public policy objectives, and because revolving forms of finance make such support more sustainable over the longer term.

  

(35)

Financial instruments supported by the ESI Funds should be used to address specific market needs in a cost effective way, in accordance with the objectives of the programmes, and should not crowd out private financing. The decision to finance support measures through financial instruments should be determined therefore on the basis of an ex ante assessment which has established evidence of market failures or sub-optimal investment situations and the estimated level and scope of public investment needs. The essential elements of the ex ante assessments should be clearly defined in this Regulation. Given the detailed nature of the ex ante assessment, provisions should be made allowing for the performance of the ex ante assessment in stages and also for reviewing and updating the ex ante assessment during implementation.

  

(36)

Financial instruments should be designed and implemented so as to promote substantial participation by private sector investors and financial institutions on an appropriate risk-sharing basis. To be sufficiently attractive to the private sector, it is essential that financial instruments are designed and implemented in a flexible manner. Managing authorities should therefore decide on the most appropriate forms for implementing financial instruments in order to address the specific needs of the target regions, in accordance with the objectives of the relevant programme, the results of the ex ante assessment and applicable State aid rules. Where applicable, such flexibility should also include the possibility to reuse part of the resources paid back during the eligibility period in order to provide for the preferential remuneration of private investors or public investors operating under the market economy principle. Such preferential remuneration should take into account market standards and ensure that any State aid complies with applicable Union and national law and is limited to the minimum amount necessary to compensate for the lack of private capital available, taking into account market failures or suboptimal investment situations.

  

(37)

In order to take account of the repayable character of support provided through financial instruments and to align with market practices, support from the ESI Funds provided to final recipients in the form of equity or quasi-equity investments, loans or guarantees, or other risk-sharing instruments should be able to cover the entirety of the investments made by final recipients, without distinction of VAT related costs. Accordingly it should only be in cases where financial instruments are combined with grants that the way in which VAT is taken into account at the level of the final recipient should be relevant for the purposes of determining eligibility of expenditure related to the grant.

  

(38)

It could be justified where certain parts of an investment do not generate sufficient direct financial returns, to combine financial instruments with grant support, to the extent allowed under the applicable State aid rules, in order for the projects to be economically sustainable. Specific conditions preventing double financing in such a case should be set out.

  

(39)

In order to ensure that resources allocated to financial instruments in favour of SMEs achieve an effective and efficient critical mass of new SME debt finance, it should be possible to use those resources in the entire territory of the Member State concerned regardless of the categories of region therein. However, it should also be possible for negotiation of the funding agreement between the Member State and the EIB to allow for a pro-rata return to a region or group of regions within the same Member State, as part of a single dedicated national programme per financial contribution by the ERDF and EAFRD.

  

(40)

The contributions by Member States to joint uncapped guarantee and securitisation financial instruments in favour of SMEs should be phased over the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the amounts to be paid by the Member States to the EIB should be scheduled accordingly in the funding agreement, in line with standard banking practice and with a view to spreading the effects on payment appropriations in any individual year.

  

(41)

In the case of securitisation transactions it should be ensured at programme closure that at least the amount corresponding to the Union contribution has been used for the objective of supporting SMEs, in line with the principles relating to financial instruments set out in the Financial Regulation.

  

(42)

Managing authorities should have the flexibility to contribute resources from programmes to financial instruments set up at Union level and managed directly or indirectly by the Commission, or to instruments set up at national, regional, transnational or cross-border level and managed by or under the responsibility of the managing authority. Managing authorities should also have the possibility of implementing financial instruments directly, through existing or newly created funds or through funds of funds.

  

(43)

In the interests of ensuring proportionate control arrangements and of safeguarding the added value of financial instruments, intended final recipients should not be deterred by there being an excessive administrative burden. The bodies responsible for the audits of programmes should in the first instance carry out audits at the level of managing authorities and the bodies implementing financial instruments including funds of funds. However, there may be specific circumstances where the necessary documents to complete such audits are not available at the level of the managing authorities or at the level of the bodies implementing financial instruments or where such documents do not represent a true and accurate record of support provided. In such specific cases, it is necessary to lay down certain provisions to also allow for audits at the level of final recipients.

  

(44)

The amount of the resources paid at any time from the ESI Funds to financial instruments should correspond to the amount necessary to implement planned investments and payments to final recipients, including management costs and fees. Accordingly, applications for interim payments should be phased. The amount to be paid as an interim payment should be subject to a maximum ceiling of 25 % of the total amount of programme contributions committed to the financial instrument under the relevant funding agreement, with subsequent interim payments conditional on a minimum percentage of the actual amounts included in previous applications having been spent as eligible expenditure.

  

(45)

It is necessary to lay down specific rules regarding the amounts to be accepted as eligible expenditure at closure of a programme, to ensure that the amounts, including the management costs and fees, paid from the ESI Funds to financial instruments are effectively used for investments in final recipients. The rules should be sufficiently flexible to make it possible to support equity-based instruments for the benefit of targeted enterprises and should, therefore, take into account certain characteristics specific to equity-based instruments for enterprises, such as market practices in relation to the provision of follow-on finance in the field of venture capital funds. Subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation, targeted enterprises should be able to benefit from continued support from the ESI Funds to such instruments after the end of the eligibility period.

  

(46)

It is also necessary to lay down specific rules regarding the reuse of resources attributable to support from the ESI Funds until the end of the eligibility period and to lay down further rules regarding the use of resources after the end of the eligibility period.

  

(47)

As a general rule, support from the ESI Funds should not be used to finance investments which have already been physically completed or fully implemented at the date of the investment decision. However, in respect of infrastructure investments with the objective of supporting urban development or urban regeneration or similar infrastructure investments with the objective of diversifying non-agricultural activities in rural areas, a certain amount of support could be necessary for the re-organisation of a debt portfolio regarding infrastructure forming part of a new investment. In such cases it should be possible to use the support from the ESI Funds to reorganise a debt portfolio up to a maximum of 20 % of the total amount of programme support from the financial instrument to the investment.

  

(48)

Member States should monitor programmes in order to review implementation and progress towards achieving the programme's objectives. To this end, monitoring committees should be set up by the Member State, in accordance with its institutional, legal and financial framework and their composition and functions defined for the ESI Funds. Given the special nature of programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal, specific rules should be laid down for monitoring committees for those programmes. Joint monitoring committees could be set up to facilitate coordination between the ESI Funds. In order to ensure effectiveness, a monitoring committee should be able to make observations to managing authorities regarding implementation and evaluation of the programme, including actions related to the reduction of the administrative burden on beneficiaries and should monitor actions taken as a result of its observations.

  

(49)

Alignment of the monitoring and reporting arrangements of the ESI Funds is necessary to simplify management arrangements at all levels. It is important to ensure proportionate reporting requirements but also the availability of comprehensive information on progress made at key review points. Therefore it is necessary that reporting requirements reflect information needs in given years and are aligned with the timing of the performance review.

  

(50)

With a view to monitoring progress of programmes, an annual review meeting should take place between each Member State and the Commission. The Member State and the Commission should however be able to agree not to organise the meeting in years other than 2017 and 2019 in order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden.

  

(51)

In order for the Commission to monitor progress made towards achieving Union objectives as well as Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, Member States should submit progress reports on the implementation of their Partnership Agreements. On the basis of such reports, the Commission should prepare a strategic report on progress in 2017 and 2019. In order to provide for a regular strategic policy debate on the contribution of the ESI Funds to the achievement of the Union strategy on smart sustainable and inclusive growth, and to improve the quality of spending and the effectiveness of the policy in line with the European Semester, the strategic reports should be debated in the Council. On the basis of that debate the Council should be able to provide input to the assessment made at the spring meeting of the European Council on the role of all Union policies and instruments in delivering sustainable job-creating growth across the Union.

  

(52)

It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of assistance from the ESI Funds in order to improve the quality of design and implementation of programmes, and to determine the impact of programmes in relation to the targets under the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and, having regard to the size of the programme, in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment in the programme area concerned, where appropriate. The responsibilities of Member States and the Commission in this regard should be specified.

  

(53)

In order to improve the quality of the design of each programme, and verify whether its objectives and targets can be reached, an ex ante evaluation of each programme should be carried out.

  

(54)

An evaluation plan should be drawn up by the managing authority or Member State. It should be possible for that evaluation plan to cover more than one programme. During the programming period managing authorities should ensure that evaluations are carried out to assess the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of a programme. The monitoring committee and the Commission should be informed about the results of evaluations to facilitate management decisions.

  

(55)

Ex post evaluations should be carried out in order to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the ESI Funds and their impact on the overall goals of the ESI Funds and the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, taking account of the targets established for that Union strategy. For each of the ESI Funds, the Commission should prepare a synthesis report outlining the main conclusions of the ex-post evaluations.

  

(56)

The types of action that can be undertaken at the initiative of the Commission and of the Member States as technical assistance with support from the ESI Funds should be specified.

  

(57)

In order to ensure an effective use of Union resources, and avoid the over-financing of operations generating net revenue after completion, different methods should be used to determine the net revenue generated by such operations, including a simplified approach based on flat rates for sectors or subsectors. The flat rates should be based on historical data available to the Commission, the potential for cost recovery and the polluter-pays principle, where applicable. There should also be provision to extend flat rates to new sectors, introduce subsectors or review the rates for future operations when new data becomes available, by means of a delegated act. The use of flat rates could be particularly suitable for operations in the fields of information and communication technologies (ICT), RDI and energy efficiency. In addition, to ensure the application of the principle of proportionality and to take account of other regulatory and contractual provisions that could apply, it is necessary to set out the exemptions from those rules.

  

(58)

It is important to ensure a proportionate approach and avoid a duplication of the verification of financing needs in the case of operations which generate net revenue after completion which are also subject to State aid rules, given that such rules also establish limits on support which can be granted. Consequently, where there is de minimis aid, compatible State aid to SMEs with an aid intensity or an aid amount limit applied, or compatible State aid to large enterprises where an individual verification of financing needs in accordance with applicable State aid rules has been carried out, the provisions requiring the calculation of net revenue should not apply. Nevertheless, it should be open to a Member State to apply the methods for calculating net revenue where this is provided for in national rules.

  

(59)

Public Private Partnerships ("PPPs") can be an effective means of delivering operations which ensure the achievement of public policy objectives by bringing together different forms of public and private resources. In order to facilitate the use of ESI Funds to support operations structured as PPPs this Regulation should take account of certain characteristics specific to PPPs by adapting some of the common provisions on the ESI Funds.

  

(60)

The starting and closing dates for the eligibility of expenditure should be defined so as to provide for a uniform and equitable rule applying to the implementation of the ESI Funds across the Union. In order to facilitate the execution of programmes, it is appropriate to specify that the starting date for the eligibility of expenditure can be prior to 1 January 2014 if the Member State concerned submits a programme before that date. Taking into account the urgent need to mobilise the resources allocated to the YEI to support its immediate implementation, exceptionally the starting date for the eligibility of expenditure should be 1 September 2013. With a view to ensuring an effective use of ESI Funds and reducing the risk to the budget of the Union, it is necessary to put in place restrictions on support for completed operations.

  

(61)

In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and subject to exceptions provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (9)](#ntr9-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0009), the ESF Regulation, Regulation (EU) No 1300/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (10)](#ntr10-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0010), Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (11)](#ntr11-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0011), Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (12)](#ntr12-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0012) and in the EMFF Regulation, Member States should adopt national rules on the eligibility of expenditure.

  

(62)

With a view to simplifying the use of the ESI Funds and reducing the risk of error, while providing for differentiation where needed to reflect the specificities of policy, it is appropriate to define the forms of support, harmonised conditions for the reimbursement of grants and repayable assistance, flat rate financing, specific eligibility rules for grants and repayable assistance and specific conditions on the eligibility of operations depending on location.

  

(63)

It should be possible to provide support from the ESI Funds in the form of grants, prizes, repayable assistance or financial instruments, or a combination thereof, in order to provide the bodies responsible with a choice of the most appropriate form of support to address identified needs.

  

(64)

To ensure the effectiveness, fairness and sustainable impact of the intervention of the ESI Funds, provisions guaranteeing that investments in businesses and infrastructures are long-lasting and prevent the ESI Funds from being used to undue advantage should be in place. Experience has shown that a period of five years is an appropriate minimum period to be applied, except where State aid rules provide for a different period. Nevertheless, and in line with the principle of proportionality, it is possible that a more limited period of three years would be justified where the investment concerns the maintenance of investments or jobs created by SMEs. In the case of an operation comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment, and where the beneficiary is not an SME, such an operation should repay the contribution from the ESI Funds if, within 10 years of the final payment to the beneficiary, the productive activity is subject to relocation outside the Union. It is appropriate to exclude actions supported by the ESF and those not entailing productive investment or investment in infrastructure from the general requirement of durability, unless such requirements are derived from applicable State aid rules, and to exclude contributions to or from financial instruments. Sums unduly paid should be recovered and be subject to procedures applicable to irregularities.

  

(65)

Member States should adopt adequate measures to guarantee the proper set up and functioning of their management and control systems to give assurance on the legal and regular use of the ESI Funds. The obligations of Member States as regards the management and control systems of programmes, and in relation to the prevention, detection and correction of irregularities and infringements of Union law should therefore be specified.

  

(66)

In accordance with the principles of shared management, Member States and the Commission should be responsible for the management and control of programmes. Member States should have the primary responsibility, through their management and control systems, for the implementation and control of the operations in programmes. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the control over the selection and implementation of operations and the functioning of the management and control system, the functions of the managing authority should be specified.

  

(67)

Member States should fulfil the management, control and audit obligations and assume the responsibilities as laid down in the rules on shared management set out in this Regulation, the Financial Regulation and in the Fund-specific rules. Member States should ensure that, in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation, effective arrangements for the examination of complaints in relation to the ESI Funds are in place. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States should, upon request of the Commission, examine complaints submitted to the Commission falling within the scope of their arrangements and should inform the Commission of the results of examinations upon request.

  

(68)

The powers and responsibilities of the Commission with regard to verifying the effective functioning of the management and control systems, and to require Member State action, should be laid down. The Commission should also have the power to carry out on-the-spot audits and checks focused on issues relating to sound financial management in order to be able to draw conclusions concerning the performance of the ESI Funds.

  

(69)

Budget commitments of the Union should be effected annually. In order to ensure effective programme management, it is necessary to lay down common rules for pre-financing, interim requests for payment and the final balance, without prejudice to specific rules that are required for each of the ESI Funds.

  

(70)

The pre-financing payment at the start of programmes ensures that a Member State has the means to provide support to beneficiaries from the start of the implementation of the programme, so that those beneficiaries receive advances where necessary to make the planned investments and are reimbursed quickly following the submission of payment claims. Therefore, provisions should be made for initial pre-financing amounts from the ESI Funds. Initial pre-financing should be totally cleared at closure of the programme.

  

(71)

In order to safeguard the Union's financial interests, measures should be provided for that are limited in time and that allow the authorising officer by delegation to interrupt payments where there is clear evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control system, evidence of irregularities linked to a request for payment, or a failure to submit documents for the purpose of examination and acceptance of accounts. The duration of the interruption period should be for a period of up to six months, with a possible extension of that period up to nine months with the agreement of the Member State, to allow sufficient time to resolve the causes of the interruption thereby avoiding the application of suspensions.

  

(72)

In order to safeguard the budget of the Union, it is possible that it would be necessary for the Commission to make financial corrections. To ensure legal certainty for the Member States, it is important to define the circumstances under which breaches of applicable Union law, or national law related to its application, can lead to financial corrections by the Commission. In order to ensure that any financial corrections which the Commission imposes on Member States are related to the protection of the Union's financial interests, such corrections should be confined to cases where the breach of applicable Union law or national law related to applying relevant Union law concerns the eligibility, regularity, management or control of operations and the corresponding expenditure declared to the Commission. To ensure proportionality it is important that the Commission consider the nature and the gravity of the breach and the related financial implications for the budget of the Union when deciding on a financial correction.

  

(73)

In order to encourage financial discipline, it is appropriate to define the arrangements for decommitment of any part of the budgetary commitment in a programme, in particular where an amount can be excluded from decommitment, in particular where delays in implementation result from circumstances which are independent of the party concerned, abnormal or unforeseeable and the consequences of which cannot be avoided despite the diligence shown, as well as in a situation in which a request for payment has been made but for which the payment deadline has been interrupted or the payment suspended.

  

(74)

The decommitment procedure is also a necessary part of the mechanism for the allocation of the performance reserve and in such cases it should be possible to reconstitute the appropriations for their subsequent commitment to other programmes and priorities. In addition, in the implementation of certain specific financial instruments in favour of SMEs where decommitments result from the discontinuance of participation by a Member State in such financial instruments, the subsequent reconstitution of the appropriations for commitment in other programmes should be provided for. Given that the introduction of additional provisions in the Financial Regulation will be necessary in order to allow for such reconstitution of appropriations, such procedures should only apply with effect from the date of entry into force of the corresponding amendment to the Financial Regulation.

  

(75)

Additional general provisions are necessary in relation to the specific functioning of the Funds. In particular, in order to increase their added value, and to enhance their contribution to the priorities of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, the functioning of the Funds should be simplified and concentrated on the Investment for growth and jobs goal and European territorial cooperation goal.

  

(76)

Additional provisions for the specific functioning of the EAFRD and the EMFF are set out in the relevant sector-specific legislation.

  

(77)

In order to promote the TFEU objectives of economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Investment for growth and jobs goal should support all regions. To provide balanced and gradual support and reflect the level of economic and social development, resources under that goal should be allocated from the ERDF and the ESF among the less developed regions, the transition regions and the more developed regions according to their GDP per capita in relation to the EU-27 average. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of investment from the Structural Funds, to consolidate the development achieved and to encourage the economic growth and social cohesion of the Union's regions, regions whose GDP per capita for the 2007-2013 programming period was less than 75 % of the average of the EU-25 for the reference period but whose GDP per capita has grown to more than 75 % of the EU-27 average should receive at least 60 % of their indicative average annual 2007-2013 allocation. The total allocation from the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund for a Member State should be at least 55 % of its individual 2007-2013 total allocation. Member States whose per capita gross national income (GNI) is less than 90 % of that of the Union average should benefit under the Investment for growth and jobs goal from the Cohesion Fund.

  

(78)

Objective criteria should be fixed for designating eligible regions and areas for support from the Funds. To this end, the identification of the regions and areas at Union level should be based on the common system of classification of the regions established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and the Council[ (13)](#ntr13-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0013), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 105/2007[ (14)](#ntr14-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0014).

  

(79)

In order to set out an appropriate financial framework for the Funds, the Commission should establish, by means of implementing acts, the annual breakdown of available commitment appropriations using an objective and transparent method with a view to targeting the regions whose development is lagging behind, including those receiving transitional support. In order to take account of the particularly difficult situation of Member States suffering from the crisis, and in accordance with Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013[ (15)](#ntr15-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0015), the Commission should review the total allocations of all Member States in 2016 on the basis of the then available most recent statistics and, where there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/- 5 %, adjust those allocations. The required adjustment should be spread in equal proportions over the years 2017-2020.

  

(80)

In order to encourage the necessary acceleration of development of infrastructure in transport and energy as well as ICT across the Union, a Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is created, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (16)](#ntr16-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0016). Support should be provided from the Cohesion Fund to projects implementing core networks or for projects and horizontal activities identified in Part I of the Annex to that Regulation.

  

(81)

The allocation of the annual appropriations from the Funds to a Member State should be limited to a ceiling that would be fixed taking into account the GDP of that particular Member State.

  

(82)

It is necessary to fix the limits of resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and to adopt objective criteria for their allocation to regions and Member States. Member States should concentrate support to ensure sufficient investment is targeted at youth employment, labour mobility, knowledge, social inclusion and combating poverty, thus ensuring that the share of the ESF as a percentage of total combined resources for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund at Union level, excluding the support from the Cohesion Fund for transport infrastructure under the CEF and support from the Structural Funds for aid for the most deprived, in Member States is not less than 23,1 %.

  

(83)

Given the urgent priority of addressing youth unemployment in the Union's most affected regions, as well as in the Union as a whole, a YEI is created and funded from a specific allocation and from targeted investment from the ESF to add to and reinforce the considerable support already provided through the ESI Funds. The YEI should aim to support young people, in particular those not in employment, education or training residing in the eligible regions. The YEI should be implemented as a part of the Investment for growth and jobs goal.

  

(84)

In addition, in line with the headline target on poverty reduction, it is necessary to reorient the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived to promote social inclusion. A mechanism should be envisaged which transfers resources to this instrument from the Structural Funds' allocations of each Member State.

  

(85)

Taking into account the present economic circumstances, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds to each individual Member State should not result in allocations per Member State higher than 110 % of their level in real terms for the 2007–2013 programming period.

  

(86)

With a view to ensuring an appropriate allocation to each category of regions, resources from the Funds should not be transferred between less developed, transition and more developed regions except in duly justified circumstances linked to the delivery of one or more thematic objectives. Such transfers should involve no more than 3 % of the total appropriation for that category of region.

  

(87)

In order to ensure a genuine economic impact, support from the Funds should not replace public or equivalent structural expenditure by Member States under the terms of this Regulation. In addition, so that the support from the Funds takes into account a broader economic context, the level of public expenditure should be determined with reference to the general macroeconomic conditions in which the financing takes place based on the indicators provided in the stability and convergence programmes submitted annually by Member States in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/1997[ (17)](#ntr17-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0017). Verification by the Commission of the principle of additionality should concentrate on the Member States in which less developed regions cover at least 15 % of the population because of the scale of the financial resources allocated to them.

  

(88)

It is necessary to lay down additional provisions concerning the programming, management, monitoring and control of operational programmes supported by the Funds in order to strengthen the focus on results. In particular, it is necessary to set out detailed requirements for the content of the operational programmes. This should facilitate the presentation of a consistent intervention logic to tackle the development needs identified, to set out the framework for performance assessment and to underpin the effective and efficient implementation of the Funds. As a general principle a priority axis should cover one thematic objective, one Fund and one category of region. Where appropriate and in order to increase the effectiveness in a thematically coherent integrated approach, it should be possible for a priority axis to relate to more than one category of region and combine one or more complementary investment priorities from the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund under one or more thematic objectives.

  

(89)

In circumstances where a Member State prepares a maximum of one operational programme for each Fund, so that both the programmes and the Partnership Agreement are prepared at national level, specific arrangements should be set out to ensure the complementarity of such documents.

  

(90)

In order to reconcile the need for concise operational programmes setting out clear commitments by the Member States and the need to allow for flexibility for adjustment to changing circumstances, a distinction should be made between the essential elements of the operational programme which are subject to a Commission decision and other elements which are not subject to a Commission decision and can be amended by a Member State. Consequently provision should be made for procedures that allow for the amendment of those non-essential elements at national level without a decision by the Commission.

  

(91)

With a view to improving complementarities and simplifying implementation, it should be possible to combine support from the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF with support from the ESF in joint operational programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal.

  

(92)

Major projects represent a substantial share of Union spending and are frequently of strategic importance with respect to the achievement of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Therefore it is justified that operations above certain thresholds continue to be subject to specific approval procedures under this Regulation. The threshold should be established in relation to total eligible cost after taking account of expected net revenues with a higher threshold for transport projects due to the typically larger size of investments in that sector. To ensure clarity, it is appropriate to define the content of a major project application for this purpose. The application should contain the necessary information to provide assurance that the financial contribution from the Funds does not result in a substantial loss of jobs in existing locations within the Union.

  

(93)

In order to promote the preparation and implementation of major projects on a sound, economic and technical basis and to encourage the use of expert advice at an early stage, where independent experts supported by technical assistance of the Commission or, in agreement with the Commission, other independent experts, are able to provide clear statements on a major project's feasibility and economic viability, the Commission approval procedure should be streamlined. The Commission should be able to refuse approval of the financial contribution only where it establishes a significant weakness in the independent quality review.

  

(94)

In cases where an independent quality review of a major project has not been undertaken, the Member State should submit all required information and the Commission should appraise the major project to determine whether the requested financial contribution is justified.

  

(95)

For the sake of continuity of implementation, in order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden as well as for the purposes of alignment with the Commission Decision on guidelines on closure of the 2007-2013 programming period, phasing provisions are established for major projects approved under Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006[ (18)](#ntr18-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0018) whose implementation period is expected to extend over the programming period covered by this Regulation. Subject to certain conditions, there should be a fast track procedure for the notification and approval of a second or subsequent phase of a major project for which the preceding phase or phases were approved by the Commission under the 2007-2013 programming period. Each individual phase of the phased operation, which serves the same overall objective, should be implemented in accordance with the rules of the relevant programming period.

  

(96)

In order to give Member States the option of implementing part of an operational programme using a result-based approach, it is useful to provide for a joint action plan comprising a project or group of projects to be carried out by a beneficiary to contribute to the objectives of the operational programme. In order to simplify and reinforce the result orientation of the Funds, the management of the joint action plan should be exclusively based on jointly agreed milestones, outputs and results as defined in the Commission decision adopting the joint action plan. Control and audit of a joint action plan should also be limited to whether it achieves its milestones, outputs and results. Consequently, it is necessary to lay down rules on its preparation, content, adoption, financial management and control of joint action plans.

  

(97)

It is necessary to adopt specific rules in relation to the functions of the monitoring committee and the annual reports on implementation of operational programmes supported by the Funds. Additional provisions for the specific functioning of the EAFRD are set out in the relevant sector specific legislation.

  

(98)

To ensure the availability of essential and up to date information on programme implementation, it is necessary that Member States provide the Commission with the key data on a regular basis. In order to avoid an additional burden on Member States, this should be limited to data collected continuously, and the transmission should be performed by way of electronic data exchange.

  

(99)

In order to reinforce the monitoring of the progress with regard to the implementation of the Funds and to facilitate financial management, it is necessary to ensure the availability of basic financial data on the progress of implementation in a timely manner.

  

(100)

In accordance with Article 175 TFEU, the Commission is to submit Cohesion Reports to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions every three years on the progress made towards achieving the Union's economic, social and territorial cohesion. It is necessary to lay down provisions concerning the content of this report.

  

(101)

It is important to bring the achievements of the Funds to the attention of the general public and to raise awareness of the objectives of cohesion policy. Citizens should have the right to know how the Union's financial resources are invested. The responsibility to ensure that the appropriate information is communicated to the public should lie with both the managing authorities and the beneficiaries as well as with Union institutions and advisory bodies. To ensure more efficiency in communication to the public at large and stronger synergies between the communication activities undertaken at the initiative of the Commission, the resources allocated to communication actions under this Regulation should also contribute to covering the corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union in so far as they are related to the general objectives of this Regulation.

  

(102)

With a view to strengthening accessibility and transparency of information about funding opportunities and project beneficiaries, in each Member State a single website or website portal providing information on all the operational programmes, including the lists of operations supported under each operational programme, should be made available.

  

(103)

For the purpose of ensuring wide dissemination of information about the achievements of the Funds and the role of the Union therein and to inform potential beneficiaries about funding opportunities, detailed rules taking account of the size of the operational programmes in accordance with the principle of proportionality about information and communication measures, as well as certain technical characteristics of such measures, should be defined in this Regulation.

  

(104)

In order to ensure that the allocation for each Fund is concentrated on the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, it is necessary to establish ceilings for the allocation to technical assistance of the Member State. It is also necessary to ensure that the legal framework for the programming of technical assistance facilitates the creation of streamlined delivery arrangements in a context where Member States implement multiple Funds in parallel and it should be possible for that framework to comprise several categories of regions.

  

(105)

It is necessary to determine the elements for modulating the co-financing rate from the Funds to priority axes, in particular, to increase the multiplier effect of Union resources. It is also necessary to establish the maximum rates of co-financing by category of region in order to ensure that the principle of co-financing is respected through an appropriate level of public or private national support.

  

(106)

It is necessary for Member States to designate a managing authority, a certifying authority and a functionally independent auditing authority for each operational programme. To provide flexibility for Member States in setting up control systems, it is appropriate to provide for the option for the functions of the certifying authority to be carried out by the managing authority. Member States should also be allowed to designate intermediate bodies to carry out certain tasks of the managing authority or the certifying authority. Member States should in that case lay down clearly their respective responsibilities and functions.

  

(107)

In order to take account of the specific organisation of the management and control systems for the Funds and the EMFF and the need to ensure a proportionate approach, specific provisions should be laid down in relation to the designation of the managing authority and the certifying authority. In order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, the ex ante verification of compliance with the designation criteria indicated in this Regulation should be limited to the managing and certifying authority, and, in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation, no additional audit work should be required when the system is essentially the same as in the 2007-2013 programming period. There should be no requirement to approve the designation by the Commission. However, in order to increase legal certainty, Member States should have the option to submit the documents concerning the designation to the Commission subject to certain conditions laid down in this Regulation. The monitoring of compliance with the designation criteria carried out on the basis of audit and control arrangements should, where results show non-compliance with the criteria, give rise to remedial actions, and possibly to the ending of the designation.

  

(108)

The managing authority bears the main responsibility for the effective and efficient implementation of the Funds and the EMFF and thus fulfils a substantial number of functions related to programme management and monitoring, financial management and controls as well as project selection. Accordingly, the managing authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out.

  

(109)

The certifying authority should draw up and submit to the Commission payment applications. It should draw up the accounts, certifying their completeness, accuracy and veracity and that the expenditure entered in them complies with applicable Union and national rules. The certifying authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out.

  

(110)

The audit authority should ensure that audits are carried out on the management and control systems, on an appropriate sample of operations and on the accounts. The audit authority's responsibilities and functions should be set out. Audits of declared expenditure should be carried out on a representative sample of operations in order to enable the results to be extrapolated. As a general rule, a statistical sampling method should be used in order to provide a reliable representative sample. Nevertheless, audit authorities should be able to use in duly justified circumstances a non-statistical sampling method provided that the conditions laid down in this Regulation are complied with.

  

(111)

Without prejudice to the Commission's powers as regards financial control, cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in this field should be increased and criteria should be established which allow the Commission to determine, in the context of its strategy of control of national systems, the level of assurance it should obtain from national audit bodies.

  

(112)

In addition to common rules on financial management for the ESI Funds, additional provisions for the Funds and the EMFF should be laid down. In particular, with a view to ensuring reasonable assurance for the Commission prior to the acceptance of accounts, applications for interim payments should be reimbursed, at a rate of 90 % of the amount resulting from applying the co-financing rate for each priority, laid down in the decision adopting the operational programme, to the eligible expenditure for the priority. The outstanding amounts due should be paid to the Member States upon acceptance of accounts, provided that the Commission is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true.

  

(113)

Beneficiaries should receive the support in full no later than 90 days from the date of submission of the payment claim by the beneficiary, subject to the availability of funding from initial and annual pre-financing and interim payments. The managing authority should be able to interrupt the deadline where supporting documents are incomplete or there is evidence of irregularity requiring further investigation. Initial and annual pre-financing should be provided for to ensure that Member States have sufficient means to implement programmes under such arrangements. Annual pre-financing should be cleared each year with the acceptance of accounts.

  

(114)

To reduce the risk of irregular expenditure being declared, it should be possible for a certifying authority, without any need for additional justification, to include the amounts which require further verification in an interim payment application after the accounting year in which they were entered into its accounting system.

  

(115)

To ensure the appropriate application of the general rules on decommitment, the rules established for the Funds and the EMFF should detail how the deadlines for decommitment are established.

  

(116)

In order to apply the requirements of the Financial Regulation to the financial management of the Funds and the EMFF, it is necessary to set out procedures for the preparation, examination and acceptance of accounts which should ensure a clear basis and legal certainty for these arrangements. In addition, in order to allow a Member State properly to fulfil its responsibilities, it should be possible for the Member State to exclude amounts which are the subject of an ongoing assessment of legality and regularity.

  

(117)

In order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries, specific time limits should be set out during which the managing authorities are obliged to ensure the availability of documents for operations following submission of expenditure or completion of an operation. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the period for keeping the documents should be differentiated depending on the total eligible expenditure of an operation.

  

(118)

As accounts are verified and accepted every year, a significant simplification of the closure procedure should be introduced. The final closure of the programme should therefore be based only on the documents relating to the final accounting year and the final implementation report or the last annual implementation report, without any need to provide any additional documents.

  

(119)

In order to safeguard the Union's financial interests and provide the means to ensure effective programme implementation, provisions should be laid down allowing for the suspension by the Commission of payments at the level of priorities or operational programmes.

  

(120)

In order to provide legal certainty for Member States, it is appropriate to lay down the specific arrangements and procedures for financial corrections by Member States and by the Commission in respect of the Funds and the EMFF respecting the principle of proportionality.

  

(121)

It is necessary to establish a legal framework which provides robust management and control systems at national and regional level and an appropriate division of roles and responsibilities in the context of shared management. The role of the Commission should therefore be specified and clarified and proportionate rules set out for the application of financial corrections by the Commission.

  

(122)

The frequency of audits on operations should be proportionate to the extent of the Union's support from the Funds and the EMFF. In particular, the number of audits carried out should be reduced where the total eligible expenditure for an operation does not exceed EUR 200 000 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, and EUR 150 000 for the ESF, and EUR 100 000 for the EMFF. Nevertheless, it should be possible to carry out audits at any time where there is evidence of an irregularity or fraud, or, following closure of a completed operation, as part of an audit sample. The Commission should be able to review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in on-the-spot audits of the audit authority. Where the Commission does not obtain the necessary assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority by those means, the Commission should be able to carry out a re-performance of the audit activity where this is in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. In order that the level of auditing by the Commission is proportionate to the risk, the Commission should be able to reduce its audit work in relation to operational programmes where there are no significant deficiencies or where the audit authority can be relied on. In order to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiaries, specific rules should be introduced to reduce the risk of overlap between audits of the same operations by various institutions, namely the European Court of Auditors, the Commission and the audit authority.

  

(123)

In order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of a European code of conduct on partnership, supplements and amendments of Sections 4 and 7 of the CSF, criteria for determining the level of financial correction to be applied, specific rules on the purchase of land and combination of technical support with financial instruments, the role, liabilities and responsibility of bodies implementing financial instruments, the management and control of financial instruments, the withdrawal of payments to financial instruments and the consequent adjustments in respect of applications for payments, the establishment of a system of capitalisation of annual instalments for financial instruments, the specific rules setting out the criteria for determining management costs and fees on the basis of performance and the applicable thresholds as well as rules for the reimbursement of capitalised management costs and fees for equity-based instruments and micro-credit, the adjustment of the flat rate for net revenue generating operations in specific sectors, as well as the establishment of a flat rate for certain sectors or subsectors within the fields of ICT, research,

development and innovation and energy efficiency and adding sectors or subsectors, the methodology for the calculation of the discounted net revenue for net revenue-generating operations, additional rules on the replacement of a beneficiary under PPP operations, minimum requirements to be included in PPP agreements which are necessary for the application of a derogation concerning eligibility of expenditure, the definition of the flat rate applied to indirect costs for grants based on existing methods and corresponding rates applicable in Union policies, the methodology to be used in carrying out the quality review of a major project, the criteria for determining the cases of irregularity to be reported, the data to be provided and the conditions and procedures to be applied to determine whether amounts which are irrecoverable shall be reimbursed by the responsibilities of Member States, the data to be recorded and stored in computerised form within monitoring systems established by managing authorities, the minimum requirements for audit trails, the scope and content of audits and the methodology for sampling, the use of data collected during audits, and the criteria for determining serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems, for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and for applying flat rates or extrapolated financial corrections. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.

  

(124)

The Commission should be empowered to adopt, by means of implementing acts, as regards all the ESI Funds, decisions approving the elements of Partnership Agreements and their amendments, decisions approving elements of the revised Partnership Agreement, decisions on the programmes and priorities which have achieved their milestones and can benefit from the allocation of the performance reserve, decisions on the amendment of programmes as consequence of corrective actions concerning the transfer of financial allocations to other programmes, decisions on annual plans of actions to be financed from technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission, and, in the case of decommitment, decisions to amend decisions adopting programmes; and as regards the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund, decisions identifying the regions and Member States fulfilling the Investment for growth and jobs criteria, decisions setting out the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations to the Member States, decisions setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Cohesion Fund allocation to the CEF, decisions setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Structural Funds allocation to aid for the most deprived, decisions accepting transfers of parts of appropriations for the European territorial cooperation goal to the Investment for growth and jobs goal, decisions whether or not to carry out a financial correction in the case of

non-compliance with additionality, decisions adopting and amending operational programmes, decisions refusing the financial contribution to a major project, decisions on the approval of a financial contribution to a selected major project and the extension of the period for the realisation of the condition related to the approval of major projects and decisions on joint action plans; and as regards the ERDF, the ESF, the Cohesion Fund and the EMFF, decisions on non-acceptance of the accounts and the amount chargeable if the accounts were not accepted, decisions suspending interim payments and decisions on financial corrections.

  

(125)

In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the model to be used when submitting the progress report, the model of operational programme for the Funds, methodology to be used in carrying out the cost-benefit analysis on major projects, the format for information on major projects, the model for the joint action plan, the model of the annual and final implementation reports, the frequency of the reporting of irregularities and the reporting format to be used, the model for the management declaration, and the models for the audit strategy, opinion and annual control report. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (19)](#ntr19-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0019).

  

(126)

In order to ensure the necessary input and better involvement of Member States when the Commission exercises its implementing powers with regard to this Regulation in certain particularly sensitive policy areas relating to the ESI Funds and in order to strengthen the Member States' role in adopting uniform conditions in such areas or other executive measures with substantial implications or with a potentially significant impact on either the national economy, the national budget or on the proper functioning of the public administration of the Member States, the implementing acts relating to the methodology for providing information on the support for climate change objectives, the detailed arrangements to ensure a consistent approach for determining in the performance framework the milestones and targets for each priority and for assessing the achievement of the milestones and targets, standard terms and conditions for monitoring of financial instruments, the detailed arrangements for the transfer and management of programme contributions managed by the bodies implementing financial instruments, a model of the funding agreement concerning the joint uncapped guarantee and securitisation financial instruments in favour of SMEs, the models to be used when submitting additional information concerning financial instruments with the applications for payments to the Commission and when reporting on financial instruments to the Commission, the terms and conditions for the electronic data exchange system for management and control, the nomenclature, based on which the categories of intervention are to be defined concerning

the priority axis in operational programmes, the format for notification of the selected major project, the technical characteristics of information and communication measures for the operation and instructions for creating the emblem and the definition of its standard colours, the model to be used when submitting financial data to the Commission for monitoring purposes, detailed rules on the exchange of information between beneficiaries and managing authorities, certifying authorities, audit authorities and intermediate bodies, the model for the report and the opinion of the independent audit body and the description of the functions and procedures in place for the managing authorities and, where appropriate, of the certifying authorities, the technical specifications of the management and control system, the model for payment applications and the model for the accounts should be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure as established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.

  

(127)

For certain implementing acts to be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 the potential impact and implications are of such high significance to Member States that an exception from the general rule is justified. Accordingly, where no opinion is delivered by the committee, the Commission should not adopt the draft implementing act. Those implementing acts relate to setting out the methodology for providing information on the support for climate change objectives; determining the methodology for milestones and targets with regard to the performance framework; establishing the standard terms and conditions in relation to financial instruments; laying down the detailed arrangements for the transfer and management of programme contributions with regard to certain financial instruments; adopting a model of the funding agreement concerning the joint uncapped guarantee and securitisation financial instruments in favour of SMEs; establishing the model to be used when reporting on financial instruments to the Commission; determining the nomenclature, based on which the categories of intervention can be defined concerning the priority axis in operational programmes; concerning the technical characteristics of information and communication measures for the operation and instructions for creating the emblem and a definition of the standard colours; laying down the technical specifications of recording and data-storing in relation to the management and control system. The third subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 should therefore apply to those implementing acts.

  

(128)

Since this Regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, that Regulation should therefore be repealed. Nevertheless, this Regulation should not affect either the continuation or modification of assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013. Applications made or approved under Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should therefore remain valid. Special transitional rules should be also laid down by way of derogation from point (b) of Article 59(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as to when a managing authority can carry out the functions of the certifying authority for operational programmes, implemented under the previous legislative framework, for the purposes of the Commission assessment in accordance with Article 73(3) of the Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 when applying Article 123(5) of this Regulation and concerning the approval procedure of major projects under point (a) of Article 102(1) of this Regulation.

  

(129)

Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States by reason of the extent of the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions and the limit on the financial resources of the Member States and regions, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

  

(130)

In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

PART TWO

COMMON PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE ESI FUNDS

TITLE I

PRINCIPLES OF UNION SUPPORT FOR THE ESI FUNDS

Article 4

General principles

1.   The ESI Funds shall provide support, through multi-annual programmes, which complements national, regional and local intervention, to deliver the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as the Fund-specific missions pursuant to their Treaty-based objectives, including economic, social and territorial cohesion taking account of the relevant Europe 2020 Integrated Guidelines and the relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU, and of the relevant Council recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 148(4) TFEU and where appropriate at national level, the National Reform Programme.

2.   The Commission and the Member States shall ensure, taking account of the specific context of each Member State, that support from the ESI Funds is consistent with the relevant policies, horizontal principles referred to in Articles 5, 7 and 8 and priorities of the Union, and that it is complementary to other instruments of the Union.

3.   Support from the ESI Funds shall be implemented in close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.

4.   Member States, at the appropriate territorial level, in accordance with their institutional, legal and financial framework, and the bodies designated by them for that purpose shall be responsible for preparing and implementing programmes and carrying out their tasks, in partnership with the relevant partners referred to in Article 5, in compliance with this Regulation and the Fund-specific rules.

5.   Arrangements for the implementation and use of the ESI Funds, and in particular the financial and administrative resources required for the preparation and implementation of programmes, in relation to monitoring, reporting, evaluation, management and control, shall respect the principle of proportionality having regard to the level of support allocated and shall take into account the overall aim of reducing the administrative burden on bodies involved in the management and control of the programmes.

6.   In accordance with their respective responsibilities, the Commission and the Member States shall ensure coordination between the ESI Funds and between the ESI Funds and other relevant Union policies, strategies and instruments, including those in the framework of the Union's external action.

7.   The part of the budget of the Union allocated to the ESI Funds shall be implemented within the framework of shared management between the Member States and the Commission, in accordance with Article 59 of the Financial Regulation, with the exception of the amount of support from the Cohesion Fund transferred to the CEF referred to in Article 92(6) of this Regulation, innovative actions at the initiative of the Commission under Article 8 of the ERDF Regulation, technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission and the support for direct management under the EMFF Regulation.

8.   The Commission and the Member States shall respect the principle of sound financial management in accordance with Article 30 of the Financial Regulation.

9.   The Commission and the Member States shall ensure the effectiveness of the ESI Funds during preparation and implementation, in relation to monitoring, reporting and evaluation.

10.   The Commission and the Member States shall carry out their respective roles in relation to the ESI Funds with the aim of reducing the administrative burden on beneficiaries.

Article 5

Partnership and multi-level governance

1.   For the Partnership Agreement and each programme, each Member State shall in accordance with its institutional and legal framework organise a partnership with the competent regional and local authorities. The partnership shall also include the following partners:

  

(a)

competent urban and other public authorities;

  

(b)

economic and social partners; and

  

(c)

relevant bodies representing civil society, including environmental partners, non-governmental organisations, and bodies responsible for promoting social inclusion, gender equality and non-discrimination.

3.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 149 to provide for a European code of conduct on partnership (the 'code of conduct') in order to support and facilitate Member States in the organisation of partnership in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. The code of conduct shall set out the framework within which the Member States, in accordance with their institutional and legal framework as well as their national and regional competences, shall pursue the implementation of partnership. The code of conduct, while fully respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, shall lay down the following elements:

  

(a)

the main principles concerning transparent procedures to be followed for the identification of the relevant partners including, where appropriate, their umbrella organisations in order to facilitate Member States in designating the most representative relevant partners, in accordance with their institutional and legal framework;

Article 8

Sustainable development

The objectives of the ESI Funds shall be pursued in line with the principle of sustainable development and with the Union's promotion of the aim of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, as set out in Article 11 and Article 191(1) TFEU, taking into account the polluter pays principle.

The Member States and the Commission shall ensure that environmental protection requirements, resource efficiency, climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, disaster resilience, and risk prevention and management are promoted in the preparation and implementation of Partnership Agreements and programmes. Member States shall provide information on the support for climate change objectives using a methodology based on the categories of intervention, focus areas or measures, as appropriate, for each of the ESI Funds. That methodology shall consist of assigning a specific weighting to the support provided under the ESI Funds at a level which reflects the extent to which such support makes a contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. The specific weighting assigned shall be differentiated on the basis of whether the support makes a significant or a moderate contribution towards climate change objectives. Where the support does not contribute towards those objectives or the contribution is insignificant, a weighting of zero shall be assigned. In the case of the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund weightings shall be attached to categories of intervention established within the nomenclature adopted by the Commission. In the case of the EAFRD weightings shall be attached to focus areas set out in the EAFRD Regulation and in the case of the EMFF to measures set out in the EMFF Regulation.

The Commission shall set out uniform conditions for each of the ESI Funds for the application of the methodology referred to in the second paragraph by means of an implementing act. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

CHAPTER III

Thematic concentration, ex ante conditionalities and performance review

Article 18

Thematic concentration

Member States shall concentrate support, in accordance with the Fund-specific rules, on interventions that bring the greatest added value in relation to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth taking into account the key territorial challenges of the various types of territories in line with the CSF, the challenges identified in the National Reform Programmes, where appropriate, and relevant country-specific recommendations under Article 121(2) TFEU and the relevant Council recommendations adopted under Article 148(4) TFEU. Provisions on thematic concentration under the Fund-specific rules shall not apply to technical assistance.

Article 19

Ex ante conditionalities

1.   Member States shall assess in accordance with their institutional and legal framework and in the context of the preparation of the programmes and, where appropriate, the Partnership Agreement, whether the ex ante conditionalities laid down in the respective Fund-specific rules and the general ex ante conditionalities set out in Part II of Annex XI are applicable to the specific objectives pursued within the priorities of their programmes and whether the applicable ex ante conditionalities are fulfilled.

Ex ante conditionalities shall apply only to the extent and provided that they comply with the definition laid down in point (33) of Article 2 regarding the specific objectives pursued within the priorities of the programme. The assessment of applicability shall, without prejudice to the definition laid down in point (33) of Article 2, take account of the principle of proportionality in accordance with Article 4(5) having regard to the level of support allocated, where appropriate. The assessment of fulfilment shall be limited to the criteria laid down in the Fund-specific rules and in Part II of Annex XI.

2.   The Partnership Agreement shall set out a summary of the assessment of the fulfilment of applicable ex ante conditionalities at national level and for those which, pursuant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, are not fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement, the actions to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timetable for the implementation of those actions. Each programme shall identify which of the ex ante conditionalities laid down in the relevant Fund-specific rules and the general ex ante conditionalities set out in Part II of Annex XI are applicable to it and, which of them, pursuant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 1, are fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement and programmes. Where the applicable ex ante conditionalities are not fulfilled, the programme shall contain a description of the actions to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timetable for their implementation. Member States shall fulfil those ex ante conditionalities not later than 31 December 2016 and report on their fulfilment not later than in the annual implementation report in 2017 in accordance with Article 50(4) or the progress report in 2017 in accordance with point (c) of Article 52(2).

3.   The Commission shall assess the consistency and the adequacy of the information provided by the Member State on the applicability of ex ante conditionalities and on the fulfilment of applicable ex ante conditionalities in the framework of its assessment of the programmes and, where appropriate, of the Partnership Agreement.

That assessment of applicability by the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 4(5), take account of the principle of proportionality having regard to the level of support allocated, where appropriate. The assessment of fulfilment by the Commission shall be limited to the criteria laid down in the Fund-specific rules and in Part II of Annex XI, and shall respect national and regional competences to decide on the specific and adequate policy measures including the content of strategies.

4.   In the event of disagreement between the Commission and a Member State on the applicability of an ex ante conditionality to the specific objective of the priorities of a programme or its fulfilment, both the applicability in accordance with the definition in point (33) of Article 2 and the non-fulfilment shall be proven by the Commission.

5.   The Commission may decide, when adopting a programme, to suspend all or part of interim payments to the relevant priority of that programme pending the completion of actions referred to in paragraph 2 where necessary to avoid significant prejudice to the effectiveness and efficiency of the achievement of the specific objectives of the priority concerned. The failure to complete actions to fulfil an applicable ex ante conditionality which has not been fulfilled at the date of submission of the Partnership Agreement and the respective programmes, by the deadline set out in paragraph 2, shall constitute a ground for suspending interim payments by the Commission to the priorities of the programme concerned that are affected. In both cases, the scope of suspension shall be proportionate, taking into account the actions to be taken and the funds at risk.

6.   Paragraph 5 shall not apply in the event of agreement between the Commission and the Member State on the non-applicability of an ex ante conditionality or on the fact that an applicable ex ante conditionality has been fulfilled, as indicated by the approval of the programme and the Partnership Agreement, or in the absence of Commission observations within 60 days of the submission of the relevant report referred to in paragraph 2.

7.   The Commission shall without delay lift the suspension of interim payments for a priority where a Member State has completed actions relating to the fulfilment of ex ante conditionalities applicable to the programme concerned and which had not been fulfilled at the time of the decision of the Commission on the suspension. It shall also without delay lift the suspension where, following amendment of the programme related to the priority concerned, the ex ante conditionality concerned is no longer applicable.

8.   Paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal.

Article 20

Performance reserve

6 % of the resources allocated to the ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal referred to in point (a) of Article 89(2) of this Regulation, as well as to the EAFRD and to measures financed under shared management in accordance with the EMFF Regulation shall constitute a performance reserve which shall be established in the Partnership Agreement and programmes and allocated to specific priorities in accordance with Article 22 of this Regulation.

The following resources are excluded for the purpose of calculating the performance reserve:

  

(a)

resources allocated to the YEI as defined in the operational programme in accordance with Article 18 of the ESF Regulation;

  

(b)

resources allocated to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission;

  

(c)

resources transferred from the first pillar of the CAP to the EAFRD under Articles 7(2) and 14(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013;

  

(d)

transfers to the EAFRD in application of Articles 10b, 136 and 136b of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar years 2013 and 2014 respectively;

  

(e)

resources transferred to the CEF from the Cohesion Fund in accordance with Article 92(6) of this Regulation;

  

(f)

resources transferred to the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived in accordance with Article 92(7) of this Regulation;

  

(g)

resources allocated for innovative actions for sustainable urban development in accordance with Article 92(8) of this Regulation.

Article 21

Performance review

1.   The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall undertake a review of the performance of the programmes in each Member State in 2019 (the 'performance review'), with reference to the performance framework set out in the respective programmes. The method for establishing the performance framework is set out in Annex II.

2.   The performance review shall examine the achievement of the milestones of the programmes at the level of priorities, on the basis of the information and the assessments presented in the annual implementation report submitted by the Member States in the year 2019.

Article 22

Application of the performance framework

1.   The performance reserve shall constitute between 5 and 7 % of the allocation to each priority within a programme, with the exception of priorities dedicated to technical assistance and programmes dedicated to financial instruments in accordance with Article 39. The total amount of the performance reserve allocated by ESI Fund and category of region shall be 6 %. The amounts corresponding to the performance reserve shall be set out in the programmes broken down by priority and, where appropriate, by ESI Fund and by category of region.

2.   On the basis of the performance review, the Commission shall within two months of the receipt of the respective annual implementation reports in the year 2019 adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, to determine for each ESI Fund and Member State, the programmes and priorities which have achieved their milestones, setting out that information by ESI Fund and by category of region, where a priority covers more than one ESI Fund or category of region.

3.   The performance reserve shall be allocated only to programmes and priorities which have achieved their milestones. Where priorities have achieved their milestones the amount of the performance reserve established for the priority shall be considered to be definitively allocated on the basis of the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 2.

4.   Where priorities have not achieved their milestones, the Member State shall propose the reallocation of the corresponding amount of the performance reserve to priorities set out in the Commission decision referred to in paragraph 2, and other amendments to the programme which result from the reallocation of the performance reserve, no later than three months after the adoption of the decision referred to in paragraph 2.

The Commission shall approve, in accordance with Article 30(3) and (4), the amendment of the programmes concerned. Where a Member State fails to submit the information in accordance with Article 50(5) and (6), the performance reserve for the programmes or the priorities concerned shall not be allocated to the programmes or the priorities concerned.

5.   The Member State's proposal to reallocate the performance reserve shall be consistent with thematic concentration requirements and minimum allocations set out in this Regulation and the Fund-specific rules. By way of derogation, where one or more of the priorities linked to thematic concentration requirements or minimum allocations have not achieved their milestones, the Member State may propose a reallocation of the reserve, which does not comply with the aforementioned requirements and minimum allocations.

6.   Where there is evidence, resulting from the performance review for a priority, that there has been a serious failure in achieving that priority's milestones relating only to the financial and output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework and that that failure is due to clearly identified implementation weaknesses, which the Commission had previously communicated pursuant to Article 50(8) following close consultations with the Member State concerned, and that Member State has failed to take the necessary corrective action to address such weaknesses, the Commission may, not earlier than five months after such communication, suspend all or part of an interim payment of a priority of a programme in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Fund-specific rules.

The Commission shall without delay lift the suspension of interim payments when the Member State has taken the necessary corrective action. Where the corrective action concerns the transfer of financial allocations to other programmes or priorities, which have achieved their milestones, the Commission shall approve, by means of an implementing act, the necessary amendment of the programmes concerned in accordance with Article 30(2). By way of derogation from Article 30(2), in such case the Commission shall decide on the amendment no later than two months after the submission of the Member State request for amendment.

7.   Where the Commission, based on the examination of the final implementation report of the programme, establishes a serious failure to achieve the targets relating only to financial indicators, output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework due to clearly identified implementation weaknesses, which the Commission had previously communicated pursuant to Article 50(8) following close consultations with the Member State concerned, and the Member State has failed to take the necessary corrective action to address such weaknesses, the Commission may notwithstanding Article 85 apply financial corrections in respect of the priorities concerned in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

When applying financial corrections, the Commission shall take into account, with due regard to the principle of proportionality, the absorption level and external factors contributing to the failure.

Financial corrections shall not be applied where the failure to achieve targets is due to the impact of socio-economic or environmental factors, significant changes in the economic or environmental conditions in the Member State concerned or because of reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of the priorities concerned.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 to establish detailed rules on criteria for determining the level of financial correction to be applied.

The Commission shall adopt implementing acts, laying down the detailed arrangements to ensure a consistent approach for determining the milestones and targets in the performance framework for each priority and for assessing the achievement of the milestones and targets. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

CHAPTER IV

Measures linked to sound economic governance

Article 23

Measures linking effectiveness of ESI Funds to sound economic governance

1.   The Commission may request a Member State to review and propose amendments to its Partnership Agreement and relevant programmes, where this is necessary to support the implementation of relevant Council Recommendations or to maximise the growth and competitiveness impact of the ESI Funds in Member States receiving financial assistance.

Such a request may be made for the following purposes:

  

(a)

to support the implementation of a relevant country-specific recommendation adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and of a relevant Council recommendation adopted in accordance with Article 148(4) TFEU, addressed to the Member State concerned;

  

(b)

to support the implementation of relevant Council Recommendations addressed to the Member State concerned and adopted in accordance with Articles 7(2) or 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011[ (29)](#ntr29-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0029) of the European Parliament and of the Council provided that these amendments are deemed necessary to help correct the macro-economic imbalances; or

  

(c)

to maximise the growth and competitiveness impact of the available ESI Funds, if a Member State meets one of the following conditions:

  

(i)

Union financial assistance is made available to it under Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010[ (30)](#ntr30-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0030);

  

(ii)

financial assistance is made available to it in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002[ (31)](#ntr31-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0031);

  

(iii)

financial assistance is made available to it that triggers a macroeconomic adjustment programme in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (32)](#ntr32-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0032) or that triggers a decision of the Council in accordance with Article 136(1) TFEU.

For the purposes of point (b) of the second subparagraph, each of those conditions shall be deemed to be satisfied where such assistance has been made available to the Member State before or after 21 December 2013 and remains available to it.

2.   A request by the Commission to a Member State in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be justified, with reference to the need to support the implementation of the relevant recommendations or to maximise the growth and competitiveness impact of the ESI Funds as appropriate, and shall indicate the programmes or priorities which it considers are concerned and the nature of the amendments expected.

If necessary, the Commission shall make observations within one month of the receipt of that response.

4.   The Member State shall submit a proposal to amend the Partnership Agreement and the relevant programmes within two months of the date of submission of the response referred to in paragraph 3.

5.   Where the Commission has not submitted observations or where the Commission is satisfied that any observations submitted have been duly taken into account, the Commission shall adopt a decision approving the amendments to the Partnership Agreement and the relevant programmes without undue delay and in any event not later than three months after their submission by the Member State in accordance with paragraph 3.

6.   Where the Member State fails to take effective action in response to a request made in accordance with paragraph 1, within the deadlines set out in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Commission may, within three months following its observations under paragraph 3 or following the submission of the proposal of the Member State under paragraph 4, propose to the Council that it suspend part or all of the payments for the programmes or priorities concerned. In its proposal, the Commission shall set out the grounds for concluding that the Member State has failed to take effective action. In making its proposal, the Commission shall take account of all relevant information, and shall give due consideration to any elements arising from and opinions expressed through the structured dialogue under paragraph 15.

The Council shall decide on that proposal, by means of an implementing act. That implementing act shall only apply with respect to requests for payment submitted after the date of the adoption of that implementing act.

7.   The scope and level of the suspension of payments imposed in accordance with paragraph 6, shall be proportionate and effective, and respect equality of treatment between Member States, in particular with regard to the impact of the suspension on the economy of the Member State concerned. The programmes to be suspended shall be determined on the basis of the needs identified in the request referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.

The suspension of payments shall not exceed 50 % of the payments of each of the programmes concerned. The decision may provide for an increase in the level of the suspension up to 100 % of payments if the Member State fails to take effective action in response to a request made in accordance with paragraph 1, within three months of the decision to suspend payments referred to in paragraph 6.

8.   Where the Member State has proposed amendments to the Partnership Agreement and the relevant programmes as requested by the Commission, the Council acting on a proposal from the Commission shall decide on the lifting of the suspension of payments.

9.   The Commission shall make a proposal to the Council to suspend part or all of the commitments or payments for the programmes of a Member State in the following cases:

  

(a)

where the Council decides in accordance with Article 126(8) or Article 126(11) TFEU that a Member State has not taken effective action to correct its excessive deficit;

  

(b)

where the Council adopts two successive recommendations in the same imbalance procedure, in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 on the grounds that a Member State has submitted an insufficient corrective action plan;

  

(c)

where the Council adopts two successive decisions in the same imbalance procedure in accordance with Article 10(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 establishing non-compliance by a Member State on the grounds that it has not taken the recommended corrective action;

  

(d)

where the Commission concludes that a Member State has not taken measures to implement the adjustment programme referred to in Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 or Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 and as a consequence decides not to authorise the disbursement of the financial assistance granted to that Member State;

  

(e)

where the Council decides that a Member State does not comply with the macro-economic adjustment programme referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, or with the measures requested by a Council decision adopted in accordance with Article 136(1) TFEU.

In making its proposal, the Commission shall respect the provisions of paragraph 11 and shall take account of all relevant information in that regard, and it shall give due consideration to any elements arising from and opinions expressed through the structured dialogue under paragraph 15.

Priority shall be given to the suspension of commitments: payments shall be suspended only when immediate action is sought and in the case of significant non-compliance. The suspension of payments shall apply to requests for payment submitted for the programmes concerned after the date of the decision to suspend.

10.   A proposal by the Commission referred to in paragraph 9 in relation to the suspension of commitments shall be deemed adopted by the Council unless the Council decides, by means of an implementing act, to reject such a proposal by qualified majority within one month of the submission of the Commission proposal. The suspension of commitments shall apply to the commitments from the ESI Funds for the Member State concerned from 1 January of the year following the decision to suspend.

The Council shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, on a proposal by the Commission referred to in paragraph 9 in relation to the suspension of payments.

11.   The scope and level of the suspension of commitments or payments to be imposed on the basis of paragraph 10, shall be proportionate, respect the equality of treatment between Member States and take into account the economic and social circumstances of the Member State concerned, in particular the level of unemployment of the Member State concerned in relation to the Union average and the impact of the suspension on the economy of the Member State concerned. The impact of suspensions on programmes of critical importance to address adverse economic or social conditions shall be a specific factor to be taken into account.

Detailed provisions for determining the scope and level of suspensions are set out in Annex III.

The suspension of commitments shall be subject to the lower of the following ceilings:

In determining the level of the suspension and whether to suspend commitments or payments, the stage of the programme cycle shall be taken into account having regard in particular to the period remaining for using the funds following the re-budgeting of suspended commitments.

12.   Without prejudice to de-commitment rules set out in Articles 86 to 88 the Commission shall lift the suspension of commitments, without delay, in the following cases:

  

(a)

where the excessive deficit procedure is held in abeyance in accordance with Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97[ (33)](#ntr33-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0033) or the Council has decided in accordance with Article 126(12) TFEU to abrogate the decision on the existence of an excessive deficit;

  

(b)

where the Council has endorsed the corrective action plan submitted by the Member State concerned in accordance with Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 or the excessive imbalance procedure is placed in a position of abeyance in accordance with Article 10(5) of that Regulation or the Council has closed the excessive imbalance procedure in accordance with Article 11 of that Regulation;

When lifting the suspension of commitments, the Commission shall re-budget the suspended commitments in accordance with Article 8 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013.

A decision concerning the lifting of the suspension of payments shall be taken by the Council on a proposal from the Commission where the applicable conditions set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph are fulfilled.

13.   Paragraphs 6 to 12 shall not apply to the United Kingdom in so far as the suspension of commitments or of payments relate to matters covered by points (a), (b) and (c)(iii) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 or points (a), (b) or (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 9.

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ

Territorial development

Article 36

Integrated territorial investment

1.   Where an urban development strategy or other territorial strategy, or a territorial pact referred to in Article 12(1) of the ESF Regulation, requires an integrated approach involving investments from the ESF, ERDF or Cohesion Fund under more than one priority axis of one or more operational programmes, actions may be carried out as an integrated territorial investment (an 'ITI').

Actions carried out as an ITI may be complemented with financial support from the EAFRD or the EMFF.

2.   Where an ITI is supported by ESF, ERDF or Cohesion Fund, the relevant operational programme or programmes shall describe the approach to the use of the ITI instrument and the indicative financial allocation from each priority axis in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

Where an ITI is complemented with financial support from the EAFRD or the EMFF, the indicative financial allocation and the measures covered shall be set out in the relevant programme or programmes in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

3.   The Member State or the managing authority may designate one or more intermediate bodies, including local authorities, regional development bodies or non-governmental organisations, to carry out the management and implementation of an ITI in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

4.   The Member State or the relevant managing authorities shall ensure that the monitoring system for the programme or programmes provides for the identification of operations and outputs of a priority contributing to an ITI.

TITLE IV

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Article 37

Financial instruments

1.   The ESI Funds may be used to support financial instruments under one or more programmes, including when organised through funds of funds, in order to contribute to the achievement of specific objectives set out under a priority.

Financial instruments shall be implemented to support investments which are expected to be financially viable and do not give rise to sufficient funding from market sources. When applying this Title, the managing authorities, the bodies implementing funds of funds, and the bodies implementing financial instruments shall comply with applicable law, in particular on State aid and public procurement.

2.   Support of financial instruments shall be based on an ex ante assessment which has established evidence of market failures or suboptimal investment situations, and the estimated level and scope of public investment needs, including types of financial instruments to be supported. Such ex ante assessment shall include:

  

(a)

an analysis of market failures, suboptimal investment situations, and investment needs for policy areas and thematic objectives or investment priorities to be addressed with a view to contributing to the achievement of specific objectives set out under a priority and to be supported through financial instruments. That analysis shall be based on available good practices methodology;

  

(b)

an assessment of the added value of the financial instruments that are being considered for support from the ESI Funds, consistency with other forms of public intervention addressing the same market, possible State aid implications, the proportionality of the envisaged intervention and measures to minimise market distortion;

  

(c)

an estimate of additional public and private resources to be potentially raised by the financial instrument down to the level of the final recipient (expected leverage effect), including as appropriate an assessment of the need for, and level of, preferential remuneration to attract counterpart resources from private investors and/or a description of the mechanisms which will be used to establish the need for, and extent of, such preferential remuneration, such as a competitive or appropriately independent assessment process;

  

(d)

an assessment of lessons learnt from similar instruments and ex ante assessments carried out by the Member State in the past, and how such lessons will be applied in the future;

  

(e)

the proposed investment strategy, including an examination of options for implementation arrangements within the meaning of Article 38, financial products to be offered, final recipients targeted and envisaged combination with grant support as appropriate;

  

(f)

a specification of the expected results and how the financial instrument concerned is expected to contribute to the achievement of the specific objectives set out under the relevant priority including indicators for that contribution;

  

(g)

provisions allowing for the ex ante assessment to be reviewed and updated as required during the implementation of any financial instrument which has been implemented based upon such assessment, where during the implementation phase, the managing authority considers that the ex ante assessment may no longer accurately represent the market conditions existing at the time of implementation.

3.   The ex ante assessment referred to in paragraph 2 may be performed in stages. It shall, in any event, be completed before the managing authority decides to make programme contributions to a financial instrument.

The summary findings and conclusions of ex ante assessments in relation to financial instruments shall be published within three months of their date of finalisation.

The ex ante assessment shall be submitted to the monitoring committee for information purposes in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

4.   Where financial instruments support financing to enterprises, including SMEs, such support shall target the establishment of new enterprises, early stage-capital, i.e. seed capital and start-up capital, expansion capital, capital for the strengthening of the general activities of an enterprise, or the realisation of new projects, penetration of new markets or new developments by existing enterprises, without prejudice to applicable Union State aid rules, and in accordance with the Fund-specific rules. Such support may include investment in both tangible and intangible assets as well as working capital within the limits of applicable Union State aid rules and with a view to stimulating the private sector as a supplier of funding to enterprises. It may also include the costs of transfer of proprietary rights in enterprises provided that such transfers take place between independent investors.

5.   Investments that are to be supported through financial instruments shall not be physically completed or fully implemented at the date of the investment decision.

6.   Where financial instruments provide support to final recipients in respect of infrastructure investments with the objective of supporting urban development or urban regeneration or similar infrastructure investments with the objectives of diversifying non-agricultural activities in rural areas, such support may include the amount necessary for the reorganisation of a debt portfolio regarding infrastructure forming part of the new investment, up to a maximum of 20 % of the total amount of programme support from the financial instrument to the investment.

7.   Financial instruments may be combined with grants, interest rate subsidies and guarantee fee subsidies. Where support from ESI Funds is provided by means of financial instruments and combined in a single operation, with other forms of support directly related to financial instruments targeting the same final recipients, including technical support, interest rate subsidies and guarantee fee subsidies, the provisions applicable to financial instruments shall apply to all forms of support within that operation. In such cases, applicable Union State aid rules shall be respected and separate records shall be maintained for each form of support.

8.   Final recipients supported by an ESI Fund financial instrument may also receive assistance from another ESI Funds priority or programme or from another instrument supported by the budget of the Union in accordance with applicable Union State aid rules. In that case, separate records shall be maintained for each source of assistance and the ESI Funds financial instrument support shall be part of an operation with eligible expenditure distinct from the other sources of assistance.

9.   The combination of support provided through grants and financial instruments as referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 may, subject to applicable Union State aid rules, cover the same expenditure item provided that the sum of all forms of support combined does not exceed the total amount of the expenditure item concerned. Grants shall not be used to reimburse support received from financial instruments. Financial instruments shall not be used to pre-finance grants.

10.   Contributions in kind shall not constitute eligible expenditure in respect of financial instruments, except for contributions of land or real estate in respect of investments with the objective of supporting rural development, urban development or urban regeneration, where the land or real estate forms part of the investment. Such contributions of land or real estate shall be eligible provided that the conditions laid down in Article 69(1) are met.

11.   VAT shall not constitute eligible expenditure of an operation, except in the case of VAT which is non-recoverable under national VAT legislation. The treatment of VAT at the level of investments made by final recipients shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the eligibility of expenditure under the financial instrument. However, where financial instruments are combined with grants under paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, the provisions of Article 69(3) shall apply to the grant.

12.   For the purposes of the application of this Article, the applicable Union State aid rules shall be those in force at the time when the managing authority or the body that implements the fund of funds contractually commits programme contributions to a financial instrument, or when the financial instrument contractually commits programme contributions to final recipients, as applicable.

13.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional specific rules on the purchase of land and on combining technical support with financial instruments.

Article 38

Implementation of financial instruments

1.   In implementing Article 37, managing authorities may provide a financial contribution to the following financial instruments:

  

(a)

financial instruments set up at Union level, managed directly or indirectly by the Commission;

  

(b)

financial instruments set up at national, regional, transnational or cross-border level, managed by or under the responsibility of the managing authority.

2.   Contributions from the ESI Funds to financial instruments under point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be placed in separate accounts and used, in accordance with the objectives of the respective ESI Funds, to support actions and final recipients consistent with the programme or programmes from which such contributions are made.

Contributions to the financial instruments referred to in the first subparagraph shall be subject to this Regulation unless exceptions are expressly provided for.

The second subparagraph is without prejudice to the rules governing the set up and functioning of the financial instruments under the Financial Regulation, unless those rules conflict with the rules of this Regulation, in which case this Regulation prevails.

3.   For financial instruments under point (b) of paragraph 1, the managing authority may provide a financial contribution to the following financial instruments:

  

(a)

financial instruments complying with the standard terms and conditions laid down by the Commission, in accordance with the second subparagraph of this paragraph;

  

(b)

already existing or newly created financial instruments which are specifically designed to achieve the specific objectives set out under the relevant priority.

The Commission shall adopt implementing acts concerning the standard terms and conditions with which the financial instruments under point (a) of the first subparagraph shall comply. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

4.   When supporting financial instruments referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 the managing authority may:

  

(a)

invest in the capital of existing or newly created legal entities, including those financed from other ESI Funds, dedicated to implementing financial instruments consistent with the objectives of the respective ESI Funds, which will undertake implementation tasks; the support to such entities shall be limited to the amounts necessary to implement new investments in accordance with Article 37 and in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of this Regulation;

  

(b)

entrust implementation tasks to:

  

(i)

the EIB;

  

(ii)

international financial institutions in which a Member State is a shareholder, or financial institutions established in a Member State aiming at the achievement of public interest under the control of a public authority;

  

(iii)

a body governed by public or private law; or

  

(c)

undertake implementation tasks directly, in the case of financial instruments consisting solely of loans or guarantees. In that case the managing authority shall be considered to be the beneficiary as defined in point (10) of Article 2.

When implementing the financial instrument, the bodies referred to in points (a),(b) and (c) of the first subparagraph shall ensure compliance with applicable law, including rules covering the ESI Funds, State aid, public procurement and relevant standards and applicable legislation on the prevention of money laundering, the fight against terrorism and tax fraud. Those bodies shall not be established and shall not maintain business relations with entities incorporated in territories, whose jurisdictions do not cooperate with the Union in relation to the application of the internationally agreed tax standards and shall transpose such requirements in their contracts with the selected financial intermediaries.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional specific rules on the role, liabilities and responsibility of bodies implementing financial instruments, related selection criteria and products that may be delivered through financial instruments in accordance with Article 37. The Commission shall notify those delegated acts simultaneously to the European Parliament and the Council by 22 april 2014.

5.   The bodies referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, when implementing funds of funds may further entrust part of the implementation to financial intermediaries provided that such entities ensure under their responsibility that the financial intermediaries satisfy the criteria laid down in Article 140(1),(2) and (4) of the Financial Regulation. Financial intermediaries shall be selected on the basis of open, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory procedures, avoiding conflicts of interest.

6.   The bodies referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 to which implementation tasks have been entrusted shall open fiduciary accounts in their name and on behalf of the managing authority, or set up the financial instrument as a separate block of finance within the financial institution. In the case of a separate block of finance, an accounting distinction shall be made between programme resources invested in the financial instrument and the other resources available in the financial institution. The assets held on fiduciary accounts and such separate blocks of finance shall be managed in accordance with the principle of sound financial management following appropriate prudential rules and shall have appropriate liquidity.

7.   Where a financial instrument is implemented under points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, subject to the implementation structure of the financial instrument, the terms and conditions for contributions from programmes to financial instruments shall be set out in funding agreements in accordance with Annex III at the following levels:

  

(a)

where applicable, between the duly mandated representatives of the managing authority and the body that implements the fund of funds; and

  

(b)

between the duly mandated representatives of the managing authority, or where applicable, the body that implements the fund of funds, and the body that implements the financial instrument.

8.   For financial instruments implemented under point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, the terms and conditions for contributions from programmes to financial instruments shall be set out in a strategy document in accordance with Annex IV to be examined by the monitoring committee.

9.   National public and private contributions, including where relevant contributions in kind as referred to in Article 37(10), may be provided at the level of the fund of funds, at the level of the financial instrument or at the level of final recipients, in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

10.   The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down uniform conditions regarding the detailed arrangements for the transfer and management of programme contributions managed by the bodies referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 4. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

Article 39

Contribution of ERDF and EAFRD to joint uncapped guarantee and securitisation financial instruments in favour of SMEs, implemented by the EIB

1.   For the purposes of this Article, 'debt finance' means loans, leasing or guarantees.

2.   Member States may use the ERDF and EAFRD to provide a financial contribution to financial instruments referred to in point (a) of Article 38(1) of this Regulation, managed indirectly by the Commission with implementation tasks entrusted to the EIB pursuant to point (c)(iii) of Article 58(1) and Article 139(4) of the Financial Regulation, in respect of the following activities:

  

(a)

uncapped guarantees providing capital relief to financial intermediaries for new portfolios of debt finance to eligible SMEs in accordance with Article 37(4) of this Regulation;

  

(b)

securitisation, as defined in point (61) of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (34)](#ntr34-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0034), of any of the following:

  

(i)

existing portfolios of debt finance to SMEs and other enterprises with less than 500 employees;

  

(ii)

new portfolios of debt finance to SMEs.

The financial contribution referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall contribute to junior and/or mezzanine tranches of portfolios mentioned therein provided that the relevant financial intermediary retains a sufficient part of the risk of the portfolios at least equal to the risk retention requirement set out in Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council[ (35)](#ntr35-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0035) and in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to ensure adequate alignment of interest. In the case of securitisation under point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the financial intermediary is obliged to originate new debt finance to eligible SMEs in accordance with Article 37(4) of this Regulation.

Each Member State intending to participate in such financial instruments shall contribute an amount which is in line with SMEs' debt financing needs in that Member State and the estimated demand for such SME debt finance, taking into account the ex ante assessment referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 and in any case which is not higher than 7 % of the allocation from the ERDF and EAFRD to the Member State. The aggregate ERDF and EAFRD contribution by all participating Member States shall be subject to a global ceiling of EUR 8 500 000 000 (in 2011 prices).

Where it is considered by the Commission in consultation with the EIB that the aggregate minimum contribution to the instrument representing the sum of the contributions of all participating Member States is insufficient taking due account of the minimum critical mass defined in the ex ante assessment referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, implementation of the financial instrument shall be discontinued and the contributions returned to the Member States.

Where the Member State and the EIB are not able to agree the conditions of the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 the Member State shall submit a request for amendment of the programme referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 and reallocate the contribution to other programmes and priorities in accordance with requirements for thematic concentration.

Where the conditions for the termination of the Member State's contribution to the instrument established in the funding agreement between the Member State concerned and the EIB referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 have been satisfied, the Member State shall submit a request for amendment of the programme referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 and reallocate the remaining contribution to other programmes and priorities in accordance with requirements for thematic concentration.

Where the participation of a Member State is discontinued, that Member State shall submit a request for amendment of the programme. Where unused appropriations are decommitted, the decommitted appropriations shall be made available again to the Member State concerned, in order to be re-programmed for other programmes and priorities in accordance with the requirements for thematic concentration.

3.   The SMEs which receive new debt finance, as a result of the new portfolio built up by the financial intermediary in the context of the financial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 shall be considered the final recipients of the contribution of the ERDF and EAFRD to the financial instrument concerned.

4.   The financial contribution referred to in paragraph 2 shall comply with the following conditions:

  

(a)

by way of derogation from Article 37(2), it shall be based on one ex ante assessment at Union level carried out by the EIB and the Commission.

On the basis of available data sources on bank debt finance and SMEs, the ex ante assessment shall cover, inter alia, an analysis of the SME financing needs at Union level, SME financing conditions and needs as well as an indication of the SME financing gap in each Member State, a profile of the economic and financial situation of the SME sector at Member State level, minimum critical mass of aggregate contributions, a range of estimated total loan volume generated by such contributions, and the added value;

  

(b)

it shall be provided by each participating Member State as part of a single dedicated national programme per financial contribution by ERDF and EAFRD supporting the thematic objective set out in point (3) of the first paragraph of Article 9;

  

(c)

it shall be subject to the conditions set out in a funding agreement concluded between each participating Member State and the EIB including, inter alia:

  

(i)

tasks and obligations of the EIB including remuneration;

  

(ii)

minimum leverage to be achieved at clearly defined milestones within the eligibility period indicated in Article 65(2);

  

(iii)

conditions for the new debt finance;

  

(iv)

provisions relating to non-eligible activities and exclusion criteria;

  

(v)

schedule of payments;

  

(vi)

penalties in the event of non-performance by financial intermediaries;

  

(vii)

selection of financial intermediaries;

  

(viii)

monitoring, reporting and auditing;

  

(ix)

visibility;

  

(x)

the conditions for termination of the agreement.

For the purposes of implementation of the instrument, the EIB will enter into contractual arrangements with selected financial intermediaries;

  

(d)

in the event that the funding agreement referred to in point (c) is not concluded within six months of the adoption of the programme referred to in point (b), the Member State shall have the right to reallocate such contribution to other programmes and priorities in accordance with requirements for thematic concentration.

The Commission shall, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt an implementing act laying down the model of the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

5.   A minimum leverage shall be achieved in each participating Member State at the milestones set out in the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4, calculated as the ratio between the new debt finance to eligible SMEs to be originated by the financial intermediaries and the corresponding contribution of the ERDF and EAFRD from the relevant Member State to the financial instruments. Such minimum leverage may vary between participating Member States.

In the event that the financial intermediary does not achieve the minimum leverage set out in the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 it shall be contractually bound to pay penalties for the benefit of the participating Member State, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the funding agreement.

Neither the guarantees issued nor the relevant securitisation transactions shall be affected by a failure by the financial intermediary to reach the minimum leverage set out in the funding agreement.

6.   By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 38(2), financial contributions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article may be placed in separate accounts per Member State or, if two or more participating Member States give their consent, in a single account covering all such Member States and used in accordance with the specific objectives of the programmes from which the contributions are made.

7.   By way of derogation from Article 41(1) and (2) as regards the financial contributions referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Member State's request for payment to the Commission shall be made on the basis of 100 % of the amounts to be paid by the Member State to the EIB in accordance with the schedule defined in the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4 of this Article. Such requests for payment shall be based on the amounts requested by the EIB deemed necessary to cover commitments for guarantee contracts or securitisation transactions to be finalised within the three following months. Payments from Member States to the EIB shall be made without delay and in any case before commitments are entered into by the EIB.

8.   At closure of the programme, the eligible expenditure shall be the total amount of programme contributions paid to the financial instrument, corresponding:

  

(a)

for the activities referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the resources referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 42(3);

  

(b)

for the activities referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the aggregate amount of new debt finance resulting from the securitisation transactions, paid to or to the benefit of eligible SMEs within the eligibility period indicated in Article 65(2).

9.   For the purpose of Articles 44 and 45, the uncalled guarantees and the amounts recovered in relation to, respectively, the uncapped guarantees and the securitisation transactions, shall be deemed to be resources paid back to the financial instruments. At the winding up of the financial instruments, the net liquidation proceeds, after deduction of costs, fees and payment of amounts due to creditors ranking senior to those contributed by the ERDF and EAFRD, shall be returned to the relevant Member States pro rata to their contributions to the financial instrument.

10.   The report referred to in Article 46(1) shall include the following additional elements:

  

(a)

the total amount of ERDF and EAFRD support paid to the financial instrument in relation to uncapped guarantees or securitisation transactions, by programme and priority or measure;

  

(b)

progress in creating the new debt finance in accordance with Article 37(4), for eligible SMEs.

11.   Notwithstanding Article 93(1), the resources allocated to instruments under paragraph 2 of this Article may be used for the purpose of giving rise to new SME debt finance in the entire territory of the Member State without regard to the categories of region, unless otherwise provided for in the funding agreement referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 4.

12.   Article 70 shall not apply to programmes set up to implement financial instruments under this Article.

Article 40

Management and control of financial instruments

1.   Bodies designated in accordance with Article 124 of this Regulation for ERDF, Cohesion Fund, ESF, EMFF and with Article 65 of the EAFRD Regulation for the EAFRD shall not carry out on-the spot verifications of operations comprising financial instruments implemented under point (a) of Article 38(1). Those designated bodies shall receive regular control reports from the bodies entrusted with the implementation of those financial instruments.

2.   The bodies responsible for the audit of programmes shall not carry out audits of operations comprising financial instruments implemented under point (a) of Article 38(1) and of management and control systems relating to those financial instruments. They shall receive regular control reports from the auditors designated in the agreements setting up those financial instruments.

3.   The bodies responsible for the audit of programmes may conduct audits at the level of final recipients only when one or more of the following situations occur:

  

(a)

supporting documents, providing evidence of the support from the financial instrument to final recipients and of its use for the intended purposes in line with applicable law, are not available at the level of the managing authority or at the level of the bodies that implement financial instruments;

  

(b)

there is evidence that the documents available at the level of the managing authority or at the level of the bodies that implement financial instruments do not represent a true and accurate record of the support provided.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 149, concerning the management and control of financial instruments referred to in point (b) of Article 38(1), including controls to be performed by managing and audit authorities, arrangements for keeping supporting documents, elements to be evidenced by supporting documents, and management and control and audit arrangements. The Commission shall notify those delegated acts simultaneously to the European Parliament and the Council by 22 April 2014.

5.   The bodies implementing financial instruments shall be responsible for ensuring that supporting documents are available and shall not impose on final recipients record-keeping requirements that go beyond what is necessary to enable them to fulfil that responsibility.

3.   In the case of equity-based instruments targeting enterprises referred to in Article 37(4) for which the funding agreement referred to in point (b) of Article 38(7) was signed before 31 December 2017, which by the end of the eligibility period invested at least 55 % of the programme resources committed in the relevant funding agreement, a limited amount of payments for investments in final recipients to be made for a period not exceeding four years after the end of eligibility period may be considered as eligible expenditure, when paid into an escrow account specifically set up for that purpose, provided that State aid rules are complied with and that all of the conditions set out below are fulfilled.

The amount paid into the escrow account:

  

(a)

shall be used solely for follow-on investments in final recipients having received initial equity investments from the financial instrument within the eligibility period, which are still wholly or partially outstanding;

  

(b)

shall be used solely for follow-on investments to be made in accordance with market standards and market standard contractual arrangements and limited to the minimum necessary to stimulate private sector co-investment, while ensuring continuity of financing for the target enterprises so that both public and private investors can benefit from investments;

  

(c)

shall not exceed 20 % of the eligible expenditure of the equity-based instrument referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 from which ceiling capital resources and gains returned to that equity-based instrument during the eligibility period shall be deducted.

Any amounts paid into the escrow account which are not used for investments in final recipients paid in the period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be used in accordance with Article 45.

4.   The eligible expenditure disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not exceed the sum of the:

  

(a)

total amount of the support from the ESI Funds paid for the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2; and

  

(b)

corresponding national co-financing.

5.   Management cost and fees as referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in paragraph 2 of this Article may be charged by the body implementing the fund of funds or bodies implementing financial instruments pursuant to points (a) and (b) of Article 38(4) and shall not exceed the thresholds defined in the delegated act referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article. Whereas management costs shall comprise direct or indirect cost items reimbursed against evidence of expenditure, management fees shall refer to an agreed price for services rendered established via a competitive market process, where applicable. Management costs and fees shall be based on a performance based calculation methodology.

Management costs and fees may comprise arrangement fees. Where arrangement fees, or any part thereof, are charged to final recipients, they shall not be declared as eligible expenditure.

Management costs and fees, including those incurred for preparatory work in relation to the financial instrument before the signature of the relevant funding agreement, shall be eligible as from the date of signature of the relevant funding agreement.

6.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 149, laying down the specific rules setting out the criteria for determining management costs and fees on the basis of performance and the applicable thresholds as well as rules for the reimbursement of capitalised management costs and fees for equity-based instruments and micro-credit.

Article 43

Interest and other gains generated by support from the ESI Funds to financial instruments

1.   Support from the ESI Funds paid to financial instruments shall be placed in accounts domiciled within financial institutions in Member States and shall be invested on a temporary basis in accordance with the principles of sound financial management.

2.   Interest and other gains attributable to support from the ESI Funds paid to financial instruments shall be used for the same purposes, including the reimbursement of management costs incurred or payment of management fees of the financial instrument in accordance with point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 42(1), and expenditure paid in accordance with Article 42(2), as the initial support from the ESI Funds either within the same financial instrument, or following the winding up of the financial instrument, in other financial instruments or forms of support in accordance with the specific objectives set out under a priority, until the end of the eligibility period.

3.   The managing authority shall ensure that adequate records of the use of interest and other gains are maintained.

Article 44

Re-use of resources attributable to the support from the ESI Funds until the end of the eligibility period

1.   Resources paid back to financial instruments from investments or from the release of resources committed for guarantee contracts, including capital repayments and gains and other earnings or yields, such as interest, guarantee fees, dividends, capital gains or any other income generated by investments, which are attributable to the support from the ESI Funds, shall be re-used for the following purposes, up to the amounts necessary and in the order agreed in the relevant funding agreements:

  

(a)

further investments through the same or other financial instruments, in accordance with the specific objectives set out under a priority;

  

(b)

where applicable, preferential remuneration of private investors, or public investors operating under the market economy principle, who provide counterpart resources to the support from the ESI Funds to the financial instrument or who co-invest at the level of final recipients;

  

(c)

where applicable, reimbursement of management costs incurred and payment of management fees of the financial instrument.

The need and the level for preferential remuneration pursuant to point (b) of the first subparagraph shall be established in the ex-ante assessment. The preferential remuneration shall not exceed what is necessary to create the incentives for attracting private counterpart resources and shall not over-compensate private investors, or public investors operating under the market economy principle. The alignment of interest shall be ensured through an appropriate sharing of risk and profit and shall be carried out on a normal commercial basis and be compatible with Union State aid rules.

2.   The managing authority shall ensure that adequate records of the use of the resources referred to in paragraph 1 are maintained.

Article 45

Use of resources after the end of the eligibility period

2.   Technical assistance measures implemented at the initiative of, or on behalf of, the Commission may be financed at the rate of 100 %.

Article 61

Operations generating net revenue after completion

1.   This Article shall apply to operations which generate net revenue after their completion. For the purposes of this Article 'net revenue' means cash in-flows directly paid by users for the goods or services provided by the operation, such as charges borne directly by users for the use of infrastructure, sale or rent of land or buildings, or payments for services less any operating costs and replacement costs of short-life equipment incurred during the corresponding period. Operating cost-savings generated by the operation shall be treated as net revenue unless they are offset by an equal reduction in operating subsidies.

Where not all the investment cost is eligible for co-financing, the net revenue shall be allocated pro rata to the eligible and non-eligible parts of the investment cost.

2.   The eligible expenditure of the operation to be co-financed from the ESI Funds shall be reduced in advance taking into account the potential of the operation to generate net revenue over a specific reference period that covers both implementation of the operation and the period after its completion.

3.   The potential net revenue of the operation shall be determined in advance by one of the following methods chosen by the managing authority for a sector, subsector or type of operation:

  

(a)

application of a flat rate net revenue percentage for the sector or subsector applicable to the operation as defined in Annex V or in any of the delegated acts referred to in the second, third and fourth subparagraphs;

  

(b)

calculation of the discounted net revenue of the operation, taking into account the reference period appropriate to the sector or subsector applicable to the operation, the profitability normally expected of the category of investment concerned, the application of the polluter-pays principle and, if appropriate, considerations of equity linked to the relative prosperity of the Member State or region concerned.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 in duly justified cases to amend Annex V by adjusting the flat rates established therein taking into account historical data, the potential for cost recovery and the polluter-pays principle where applicable.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 establishing flat rates for sectors or subsectors within the fields of ICT, RDI and energy efficiency. The Commission shall notify the delegated acts to the European Parliament and the Council not later than 30 June 2015.

In addition, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 in duly justified cases with regard to adding sectors or subsectors, including subsectors for sectors in Annex V, falling under the thematic objectives defined in the first paragraph of Article 9 and supported by the ESI Funds.

Where the method referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph is applied, all the net revenue generated during implementation and after completion of the operation shall be considered to be taken into account by the application of the flat rate and shall therefore not be deducted subsequently from the eligible expenditure of the operation.

When a flat rate for a new sector or subsector has been established by the adoption of a delegated act in accordance with the third and fourth subparagraphs, a managing authority may choose to apply the method set out in point (a) of the first subparagraph for new operations in relation to the sector or subsector concerned.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 149, laying down the method referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph. Where that method is applied, the net revenue generated during implementation of the operation, resulting from sources of revenue not taken into account in determining the potential net revenue of the operation, shall be deducted from the eligible expenditure of the operation, no later than in the final payment claim submitted by the beneficiary.

4.   The method by which the net revenue is deducted from the expenditure of the operation included in the request for payment submitted to the Commission shall be determined in accordance with national rules.

5.   As an alternative to the application of the methods laid down in paragraph 3, the maximum co-financing rate referred to in Article 60(1) may, at the request of a Member State, be decreased at the moment of adoption of a programme for a priority or measure under which all operations supported under that priority or measure could apply a uniform flat rate in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3. The decrease shall be not less than the amount calculated by multiplying the maximum Union co-financing rate applicable under the Fund-specific rules by the relevant flat rate referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3.

Where the method referred to in the first subparagraph is applied, all net revenue generated during implementation, and after completion, of the operation shall be considered to be taken into account by application of the decreased co-financing rate and shall therefore not be deducted subsequently from the eligible expenditure of the operations.

6.   Where it is objectively not possible to determine the revenue in advance based on any of the methods set out in paragraphs 3 or 5, the net revenue generated within three years of the completion of an operation, or by the deadline for the submission of documents for programme closure fixed in the Fund-specific rules, whichever is the earlier, shall be deducted from the expenditure declared to the Commission.

7.   Paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to:

  

(a)

operations or parts of operations supported solely by the ESF;

  

(b)

operations whose total eligible cost before application of paragraphs 1 to 6 does not exceed EUR 1 000 000;

  

(c)

repayable assistance subject to an obligation for full repayment and prizes;

  

(d)

technical assistance;

  

(e)

support to or from financial instruments;

  

(f)

operations for which public support takes the form of lump sums or standard scale unit costs;

  

(g)

operations implemented under a joint action plan;

  

(h)

operations for which amounts or rates of support are defined in Annex II to the EAFRD Regulation.

Notwithstanding point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, where a Member State applies paragraph 5, it may include in the relevant priority or measure operations whose total eligible cost before application of paragraphs 1 to 6 does not exceed EUR 1 000 000.

8.   In addition, paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to operations for which support under the programme constitutes:

  

(a)

de minimis aid;

  

(b)

compatible State aid to SMEs, where an aid intensity or an aid amount limit is applied in relation to State aid;

  

(c)

compatible State aid, where an individual verification of financing needs in accordance with the applicable State aid rules has been carried out.

Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, a managing authority may apply the paragraphs 1 to 6 to operations which fall under points (a) to (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph where this is provided for in national rules.

CHAPTER II

Special rules on support from the ESI Funds to PPPs

Article 62

PPPs

The ESI Funds may be used to support PPP operations. Such PPP operations shall comply with applicable law, in particular concerning State aid and public procurement.

Article 63

Beneficiary under PPP operations

1.   In relation to a PPP operation, and by way of derogation from point (10) of Article 2, a beneficiary may be either:

  

(a)

the public law body initiating the operation; or

  

(b)

a body governed by private law of a Member State (the "private partner") selected or to be selected for the implementation of the operation.

2.   The public law body initiating the PPP operation may propose that the private partner, to be selected after approval of the operation, be the beneficiary for the purposes of support from the ESI Funds. In that event, the approval decision shall be conditional on the managing authority satisfying itself that the selected private partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation.

3.   The private partner selected to implement the operation may be replaced as beneficiary during implementation where this is required under the terms and conditions of the PPP or the financing agreement between the private partner and the financial institution co-financing the operation. In that event the replacement private partner or public law body shall become the beneficiary provided that the managing authority satisfies itself that the replacement partner fulfils and assumes all the corresponding obligations of a beneficiary under this Regulation.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional rules on the replacement of a beneficiary and on the related responsibilities.

5.   The replacement of a beneficiary shall not be considered a change in ownership within the meaning of point (b) of Article 71(1) if that replacement satisfies the applicable conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article and in a delegated act adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article.

Article 64

Support for PPP operations

1.   In the case of a PPP operation where the beneficiary is a public law body, expenditure under a PPP operation which has been incurred and paid by the private partner may, by way of derogation from Article 65(2), be considered as incurred and paid by a beneficiary and included in a request for payment to the Commission provided that the following conditions are met:

  

(a)

the beneficiary has entered into a PPP agreement with a private partner;

  

(b)

the managing authority has verified that the expenditure declared by the beneficiary has been paid by the private partner and that the operation complies with applicable Union and national law, the programme and the conditions for support of the operation.

2.   Payments to beneficiaries made in respect of expenditure included in a request for payment in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be paid into an escrow account set up for that purpose in the name of the beneficiary.

3.   The funds paid into the escrow account referred to in paragraph 2 shall be used for payments in accordance with the PPP agreement, including any payments to be made in the event of termination of the PPP agreement.

4.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down the minimum requirements to be included in PPP agreements which are necessary for the application of the derogation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article, including provisions related to termination of the PPP agreement and for the purpose of ensuring an adequate audit trail.

CHAPTER III

Eligibility of expenditure and durability

Article 65

Eligibility

1.   The eligibility of expenditure shall be determined on the basis of national rules, except where specific rules are laid down in, or on the basis of, this Regulation or the Fund-specific rules.

2.   Expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from the ESI Funds if it has been incurred by a beneficiary and paid between the date of submission of the programme to the Commission or from 1 January 2014, whichever is earlier, and 31 December 2023. In addition, expenditure shall only be eligible for a contribution from the EAFRD if the relevant aid is actually paid by the paying agency between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2023.

3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 2, expenditure under the YEI shall be eligible as of 1 September 2013.

4.   In the case of costs reimbursed pursuant to points (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1), the actions constituting the basis for reimbursement shall be carried out between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2023.

5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 4, the starting date in relation to costs reimbursed on the basis of (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1) for actions under the YEI shall be 1 September 2013.

6.   Operations shall not be selected for support by the ESI Funds where they have been physically completed or fully implemented before the application for funding under the programme is submitted by the beneficiary to the managing authority, irrespective of whether all related payments have been made by the beneficiary.

7.   This Article shall be without prejudice to the rules on eligibility of technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission set out in Article 58.

8.   This paragraph shall apply to operations which generate net revenue during their implementation and to which paragraphs 1 to 6 of Article 61 do not apply.

The eligible expenditure of the operation to be co-financed from the ESI Funds shall be reduced by the net revenue not taken into account at the time of approval of the operation directly generated only during its implementation, not later than at the final payment claim submitted by the beneficiary. Where not all the costs are eligible for co-financing, the net revenue shall be allocated pro rata to the eligible and non-eligible parts of the cost.

This paragraph shall not apply to:

  

(a)

technical assistance;

  

(b)

financial instruments;

  

(c)

repayable assistance subject to an obligation for full repayment;

  

(d)

prizes;

(g)

operations implemented under a joint action plan provided that the net revenue has been taken into account ex ante;

  

(h)

operations for which amounts or rates of support are defined in Annex II to the EAFRD Regulation; or

  

(i)

operations for which the total eligible cost does not exceed EUR 50 000.

For the purposes of this Article and Article 61, any payment received by the beneficiary arising from contractual penalties as a result of a breach of contract between the beneficiary and a third party or third parties or that has occurred as a result of the withdrawal of an offer by a third party chosen under public procurement rules (the 'deposit') shall not be considered as revenue and shall not be deducted from the eligible expenditure of the operation.

9.   Expenditure that becomes eligible as a result of an amendment to a programme shall only be eligible from the date of submission to the Commission of the request for amendment or, in the event of application of Article 96(11), from the date of entry into force of the decision amending the programme.

The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may derogate from the first subparagraph.

10.   By way of derogation from paragraph 9, specific provisions on the starting date of eligibility may be established in the EAFRD Regulation.

11.   An operation may receive support from one or more ESI Funds or from one or more programmes and from other Union instruments, provided that the expenditure item included in a request for payment for reimbursement by one of the ESI Funds does not receive support from another Fund or Union instrument, or support from the same Fund under another programme.

Article 66

Forms of support

The ESI Funds shall be used to provide support in the form of grants, prizes, repayable assistance and financial instruments, or a combination thereof.

In the case of repayable assistance, the support repaid to the body that provided it, or to another competent authority of the Member State, shall be kept in a separate account or separated with accounting codes and reused for the same purpose or in accordance with the objectives of the programme.

Article 67

standard scales of unit costs;

  

(c)

lump sums not exceeding EUR 100 000 of public contribution;

  

(d)

flat-rate financing, determined by the application of a percentage to one or more defined categories of costs.

Fund-specific rules may limit the forms of grants or repayable assistance applicable to certain operations.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, additional forms of grants and methods of calculation may be established in the EMFF Regulation.

3.   The options referred to in paragraph 1 may be combined only where each option covers different categories of costs or where they are used for different projects forming a part of an operation or for successive phases of an operation.

4.   Where an operation or a project forming a part of an operation is implemented exclusively through the public procurement of works, goods or services, only point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall apply. Where the public procurement within an operation or project forming part of an operation is limited to certain categories of costs, all the options referred to in paragraph 1 may be applied.

5.   The amounts referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be established in one of the following ways:

  

(a)

a fair, equitable and verifiable calculation method based on:

the application of the usual cost accounting practices of individual beneficiaries;

  

(b)

in accordance with the rules for application of corresponding scales of unit costs, lump sums and flat rates applicable in Union policies for a similar type of operation and beneficiary;

Article 68

Flat rate financing for indirect costs and staff costs concerning grants and repayable assistance

1.   Where the implementation of an operation gives rise to indirect costs, they may be calculated at a flat rate in one of the following ways:

  

(a)

a flat rate of up to 25 % of eligible direct costs, provided that the rate is calculated on the basis of a fair, equitable and verifiable calculation method or a method applied under schemes for grants funded entirely by the Member State for a similar type of operation and beneficiary;

  

(b)

a flat rate of up to 15 % of eligible direct staff costs without there being a requirement for the Member State to perform a calculation to determine the applicable rate;

  

(c)

a flat rate applied to eligible direct costs based on existing methods and corresponding rates, applicable in Union policies for a similar type of operation and beneficiary.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 concerning the definition of the flat rate and the related methods referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph.

2.   For the purposes of determining staff costs relating to the implementation of an operation, the hourly rate applicable may be calculated by dividing the latest documented annual gross employment costs by 1 720 hours.

Article 69

Specific eligibility rules for grants and repayable assistance

1.   Contributions in kind in the form of provision of works, goods, services, land and real estate for which no cash payment supported by invoices, or documents of equivalent probative value, has been made, may be eligible on condition that the eligibility rules of the ESI Funds and the programme so provide and that all the following criteria are fulfilled:

(e)

in the case of contributions in kind in the form of unpaid work, the value of that work is determined by taking into account the verified time spent and the rate of remuneration for equivalent work.

The value of the land or real estate referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be certified by an independent qualified expert or duly authorised official body and shall not exceed the limit laid down in point (b) of paragraph 3.

2.   Depreciation costs may be considered as eligible where the following conditions are fulfilled:

  

(a)

the eligibility rules of the programme allow for it;

  

(b)

the amount of the expenditure is duly justified by supporting documents having equivalent probative value to invoices for eligible costs where reimbursed in the form referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1);

  

(c)

the costs relate exclusively to the period of support for the operation;

  

(d)

1.   Operations supported by the ESI Funds, subject to the derogations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, and the Fund-specific rules, shall be located in the programme area.

2.   The managing authority may accept that an operation is implemented outside the programme area but within the Union, provided that all the following conditions are satisfied:

  

(a)

the operation is for the benefit of the programme area;

  

(b)

the total amount allocated under the programme to operations located outside the programme area does not exceed 15 % of the support from the ERDF, Cohesion Fund and EMFF at the level of the priority, or 5 % of the support from the EAFRD at the level of the programme;

  

(c)

the monitoring committee has given its agreement to the operation or types of operations concerned;

  

(d)

a cessation or relocation of a productive activity outside the programme area;

  

(b)

a change in ownership of an item of infrastructure which gives to a firm or a public body an undue advantage;

  

(c)

a substantial change affecting its nature, objectives or implementation conditions which would result in undermining its original objectives.

Sums unduly paid in respect of the operation shall be recovered by the Member State in proportion to the period for which the requirements have not been fulfilled.

Member States may reduce the time limit set out in the first subparagraph to three years in cases concerning the maintenance of investments or jobs created by SMEs.

2.   An operation comprising investment in infrastructure or productive investment shall repay the contribution from the ESI Funds if within 10 years of the final payment to the beneficiary the productive activity is subject to relocation outside the Union, except where the beneficiary is an SME. Where the contribution from the ESI Funds takes the form of State aid, the period of 10 years shall be replaced by the deadline applicable under State aid rules.

3.   Operations supported by the ESF and operations supported by the other ESI Funds that are not investments in infrastructure or productive investments shall repay the contribution from the Fund only where they are subject to an obligation for maintenance of investment under the applicable State aid rules and where they undergo a cessation or relocation of a productive activity within the period laid down in those rules.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, EXAMINATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF ACCOUNTS AND FINANCIAL CORRECTIONS, DECOMMITMENT

CHAPTER I

Financial management

Article 76

Budget commitments

The budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. The budget commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the remaining allocation to the programme.

The decision of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 84 of the Financial Regulation and once notified to the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation.

For each programme, the budget commitments for the first instalment shall follow the adoption of the programme by the Commission.

The budget commitments for subsequent instalments shall be made by the Commission before 1 May of each year, on the basis of the decision referred to in the second paragraph of this Article, except where Article 16 of the Financial Regulation applies.

Following application of the performance framework in accordance with Article 22, where priorities have not achieved their milestones, the Commission shall where necessary decommit the corresponding appropriations committed to the programmes concerned as part of the performance reserve and shall make them available again for the programmes for which the allocation is increased as a result of an amendment approved by the Commission in accordance with Article 22(5).

Article 77

Common rules for payments

1.   Payments by the Commission of the contribution from the ESI Funds to each programme shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. Each payment shall be posted to the earliest open budget commitment of the Fund concerned.

2.   Payments related to the commitments of the performance reserve shall not be made prior to the definitive allocation of the performance reserve, in accordance with Article 22(3) and (4).

3.   Payments shall take the form of pre-financing, interim payments and payment of the final balance.

4.   For forms of support under points (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 67(1) and under Articles 68 and 69, costs calculated on the applicable basis shall be regarded as eligible expenditure.

Article 78

Common rules for calculating interim payments, and payment of the final balance

The Fund-specific rules shall lay down rules for the calculation of the amount reimbursed as interim payments, and of the final balance. That amount shall be a function of the specific co-financing rate applicable to the eligible expenditure.

Article 79

Requests for payment

1.   The specific procedure and information to be submitted for requests for payment in relation to each ESI Fund shall be laid down in the Fund-specific rules.

2.   The request for payment to be submitted to the Commission shall provide all the information necessary for the Commission to produce accounts in accordance with Article 68(3) of the Financial Regulation.

Article 80

Use of the euro

Amounts set out in programmes submitted by Member States, forecasts of expenditure, statements of expenditure, requests for payment, accounts and expenditure mentioned in the annual and final implementation reports shall be denominated in euro.

Article 81

Payment of initial pre-financing

1.   Following the Commission decision adopting the programme, an initial pre-financing amount for the whole programming period shall be paid by the Commission. The initial pre-financing amount shall be paid in instalments according to budgetary needs. The level of the instalments shall be defined in the Fund-specific rules.

2.   Initial pre-financing shall be used only for payments to beneficiaries in the implementation of the programme. It shall be made available without delay to the body responsible for that purpose.

Article 82

Clearance of initial pre-financing

The amount paid as initial pre-financing shall be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the programme is closed.

Article 83

Interruption of the payment deadline

1.   The payment deadline for an interim payment claim may be interrupted by the authorising officer by delegation within the meaning of the Financial Regulation for a maximum period of six months if:

  

(a)

following information provided by a national or Union audit body, there is clear evidence to suggest a significant deficiency in the functioning of the management and control system;

  

(b)

the authorising officer by delegation has to carry out additional verifications following information that has come to that officer's attention alerting him or her that expenditure in a request for payment is linked to an irregularity having serious financial consequences;

  

(c)

there is a failure to submit one of the documents required under Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation.

The Member State may agree to an extension of the interruption period for another three months.

The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for interruption of payments linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance.

2.   The authorising officer by delegation shall limit the interruption to the part of the expenditure covered by the payment claim affected by the elements referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, unless it is not possible to identify the part of the expenditure affected. The authorising officer by delegation shall inform the Member State and the managing authority in writing immediately of the reason for interruption and shall ask them to remedy the situation. The interruption shall be ended by the authorising officer by delegation as soon as the necessary measures have been taken.

CHAPTER II

CHAPTER III

Financial corrections

Article 85

Financial corrections by the Commission

1.   The Commission shall make financial corrections by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to a programme and effecting recovery from the Member State, in order to exclude from Union financing expenditure which is in breach of applicable law.

2.   A breach of applicable law shall lead to a financial correction only in relation to expenditure which has been declared to the Commission and where one of the following conditions is met:

  

(a)

the breach has affected the selection of an operation by the body responsible for support from the ESI Funds or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to establish that impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect;

  

(b)

the breach has affected the amount of expenditure declared for reimbursement by the budget of the Union or in cases where, due to the nature of the breach, it is not possible to quantify its financial impact but there is a substantiated risk that the breach has had such an effect.

3.   When deciding on a financial correction under paragraph 1, the Commission shall respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the breach of applicable law and its financial implications for the budget of the Union. The Commission shall keep the European Parliament informed of decisions taken to apply financial corrections.

4.   The criteria and the procedures for applying financial corrections shall be laid down in the Fund-specific rules.

CHAPTER IV

Decommitment

Article 86

Principles

1.   All programmes shall be submitted to a decommitment procedure established on the basis that amounts linked to a commitment which are not covered by pre-financing or by a request for payment within a defined period, including any request for payment for which all or part is subject to an interruption of the payment deadline or a suspension of payments, shall be decommitted.

2.   The commitment related to the last year of the period shall be decommitted in accordance with the rules to be followed for the closure of the programmes.

3.   The Fund-specific rules shall specify the precise application of the decommitment rule for each ESI Fund.

4.   The part of commitments still open shall be decommitted if any of the documents required for the closure have not been submitted to the Commission by the deadlines established in the Fund-specific rules.

5.   The budgetary commitments in respect of the performance reserve shall be subject only to the decommitment procedure set out in paragraph 4.

Article 87

Exception to the decommitment

1.   The amount concerned by decommitment shall be reduced by the amounts equivalent to that part of the budget commitment for which:

  

(a)

the operations are suspended by a legal proceeding or by an administrative appeal having suspensory effect; or

  

(b)

it has not been possible to make a request for payment for reasons of force majeure seriously affecting implementation of all or part of the programme.

The national authorities claiming force majeure under point (b) of the first subparagraph shall demonstrate the direct consequences of the force majeure on the implementation of all or part of the programme.

For the purpose of points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, the reduction may be requested once, if the suspension or force majeure lasted no longer than one year, or a number of times that corresponds to the duration of the force majeure or the number of years between the date of the legal or administrative decision suspending the implementation of the operation and the date of the final legal or administrative decision.

2.   By 31 January, the Member State shall send to the Commission information on the exceptions referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 for the amount to be declared by the end of the preceding year.

Article 88

Procedure

1.   The Commission shall inform the Member State and the managing authority in good time whenever there is a risk of application of the decommitment rule under Article 86.

2.   On the basis of the information it has received as of 31 January, the Commission shall inform the Member State and the managing authority of the amount of the decommitment resulting from that information.

3.   The Member State shall have two months to agree to the amount to be decommitted or to submit its observations.

4.   By 30 June, the Member State shall submit to the Commission a revised financing plan reflecting, for the financial year concerned, the reduced amount of support over one or more priorities of the programme taking into account the allocation by Fund and by category of region, where appropriate. Failing such submission, the Commission shall revise the financing plan by reducing the contribution from the ESI Funds for the financial year concerned. That reduction shall be allocated to each priority proportionately.

5.   The Commission shall amend the decision adopting the programme, by means of implementing acts, not later than 30 September.

PART THREE

GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE ERDF, THE ESF AND THE COHESION FUND

TITLE I

OBJECTIVES AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

CHAPTER I

Mission, goals and geographical coverage of support

Article 89

Mission and goals

1.   The Funds shall contribute to developing and pursuing the actions of the Union leading to strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion in accordance with Article 174 TFEU.

The actions supported by the Funds shall also contribute to the delivery of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

2.   For the purpose of the mission referred to in paragraph 1, the following goals shall be pursued:

  

(a)

Investment for growth and jobs in Member States and regions, to be supported by the Funds; and

  

(b)

European territorial cooperation, to be supported by the ERDF.

Article 90

Investment for growth and jobs goal

1.   The Structural Funds shall support the Investment for growth and jobs goal in all regions corresponding to level 2 of the common classification of territorial units for statistics ('NUTS level 2 regions') established by Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 amended by Regulation (EC) No 105/2007.

2.   Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall be allocated among the following three categories of NUTS level 2 regions:

  

(a)

less developed regions, whose GDP per capita is less than 75 % of the average GDP of the EU-27;

  

(b)

transition regions, whose GDP per capita is between 75 % and 90 % of the average GDP of the EU-27;

  

(c)

more developed regions, whose GDP per capita is above 90 % of the average GDP of the EU-27.

The classification of regions under one of the three categories of regions shall be determined on the basis of how the GDP per capita of each region, measured in purchasing power parities (PPS) and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2007 - 2009, relates to the average GDP of the EU-27 for the same reference period.

3.   The Cohesion Fund shall support those Member States whose GNI per capita, measured in PPS and calculated on the basis of Union figures for the period 2008 - 2010, is less than 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 for the same reference period.

The Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund in 2013, but whose nominal GNI per capita exceeds 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 as calculated under the first subparagraph shall receive support from the Cohesion Fund on a transitional and specific basis.

4.   Immediately following the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the list of regions fulfilling the criteria of the three categories of regions referred to in paragraph 2 and of Member States fulfilling the criteria of paragraph 3. That list shall be valid from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.

5.   In 2016, the Commission shall review the eligibility of Member States for support from the Cohesion Fund on the basis of Union GNI figures for the period 2012 - 2014 for the EU-27. Those Member States whose nominal GNI per capita falls below 90 % of the average GNI per capita of the EU-27 shall become newly eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund and those Member States which were eligible for the Cohesion Fund and whose nominal GNI per capita exceeds 90 %, shall lose their eligibility and shall receive support from the Cohesion Fund on a transitional and specific basis.

CHAPTER II

Financial framework

Article 91

Resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion

1.   The resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment for the period 2014 - 2020 shall be EUR 325 145 694 739 in 2011 prices, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which EUR 322 145 694 739 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund and EUR 3 000 000 000 represents a specific allocation for the YEI. For the purposes of programming and subsequent inclusion in the budget of the Union, the amount of resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion shall be indexed at 2 % per year.

2.   The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the annual breakdown of the global resources per Member State under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and the European territorial cooperation goal, and the annual breakdown of the resources from the specific allocation for the YEI per Member State together with the list of eligible regions in accordance with the criteria and methodology set out in Annexes VII and VIII respectively, without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article or to Article 92(8).

3.   0,35 % of the global resources after the deduction of the support to the CEF referred to in Article 92(6), and to the aid for the most deprived referred to in Article 92(7) shall be allocated to technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission.

Article 92

Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal

1.   Resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall amount to 96,33 % of the global resources (i.e., a total of EUR 313 197 435 409) and shall be allocated as follows:

  

(a)

52,45 % (i.e., a total of EUR 164 279 015 916) for less developed regions;

  

(b)

10,24 % (i.e., a total of EUR 32 084 931 311) for transition regions;

  

(c)

15,67 % (i.e., a total of EUR 49 084 308 755) for more developed regions;

  

(d)

21,19 % (i.e., a total of EUR 66 362 384 703) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund;

  

(e)

0,44 % (i.e., a total of EUR 1 386 794 724) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.

2.   In addition to the amounts set out in Article 91 and paragraph 1 of this Article, for the years 2014 and 2015, a further amount of EUR 94 200 000 and of EUR 92 400 000 respectively shall be made available as set out in the "Additional adjustments" under Annex VII. Those amounts shall be identified in the decision of the Commission referred to in Article 91(2).

3.   In 2016, the Commission shall, in its technical adjustment for the year 2017 in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013, review the total allocations under the Investment for growth and jobs goal of each Member State for 2017-2020, applying the allocation method set out in paragraphs 1 to 16 of Annex VII on the basis of the most recent statistics available and of the comparison, for the capped Member States, between the cumulated national GDP observed for the years 2014-2015 and the cumulated national GDP for the same period estimated in 2012 in accordance with paragraph 10 of Annex VII. Where there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/-5 % between the revised allocations and the total allocations, the total allocations shall be adjusted correspondingly. In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013, adjustments shall be spread in equal proportions over the years 2017-2020 and the corresponding ceilings of the financial framework shall be modified accordingly. The total net effect of the adjustments, whether positive or negative, shall not exceed EUR 4 000 000 000. Following the technical adjustment, the Commission, shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out a revised annual breakdown of the global resources for each Member State.

4.   In order to ensure that sufficient investment is targeted at youth employment, labour mobility, knowledge, social inclusion and combating poverty, the share of Structural Funds resources available for programming for operational programmes, under the Investment for growth and jobs goal allocated to the ESF in each Member State, shall not be lower than the corresponding ESF share for that Member State laid down in the operational programmes for the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives for the 2007-2013 programming period. To that share shall be added an additional amount for each Member State determined in accordance with the method set out in Annex IX in order to ensure that the share of the ESF as a percentage of total combined resources for the Funds at Union level, excluding the support from the Cohesion Fund for transport infrastructure under the CEF referred to in paragraph 6 and support from the Structural Funds for aid for the most deprived referred to in paragraph 7, in Member States is not less than 23,1 %. For the purposes of this paragraph, investment provided from the ESF to the YEI shall be considered to be part of the share of Structural Funds allocated to the ESF.

5.   Resources for the YEI shall amount to EUR 3 000 000 000 from the specific allocation for the YEI and at least EUR 3 000 000 000 from ESF targeted investment.

6.   The amount of support from the Cohesion Fund to be transferred to the CEF shall be EUR 10 000 000 000. It shall be spent for transport infrastructure projects in line with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 exclusively in Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund.

The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Cohesion Fund allocation to the CEF, which amount shall be determined on a pro rata basis for the whole period. The Cohesion Fund allocation of each Member State shall be reduced accordingly.

The annual appropriations corresponding to the support from the Cohesion Fund referred to in the first subparagraph shall be entered in the relevant budget lines of the CEF as of the 2014 budgetary exercise.

The amount transferred from the Cohesion Fund to the CEF, referred to in the first subparagraph, shall be implemented by launching specific calls for projects implementing the core networks or for projects and horizontal activities identified in Part I of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.

Rules applicable for the transport sector under Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 shall apply to the specific calls referred to in the fourth subparagraph. Until 31 December 2016, the selection of projects eligible for financing shall respect the national allocations under the Cohesion Fund. As of 1 January 2017, resources transferred to the CEF which have not been committed to a transport infrastructure project shall be made available to all Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund to finance transport infrastructure projects in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013.

In order to support Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund, which may experience difficulties in designing projects that are of a sufficient maturity, quality, or both, and which have sufficient added value for the Union, particular attention shall be given to programme support actions aimed at strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services in relation to the development and implementation of projects listed in Part I of Annex I to the Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013. To ensure the highest possible absorption of the transferred funds in all Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion fund, the Commission may organise additional calls.

7.   The support from the Structural Funds for aid for the most deprived under the Investment for Growth and Jobs goal shall be not less than EUR 2 500 000 000 and may be increased by up to EUR 1 000 000 000 by additional support decided on a voluntary basis by Member States.

The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act, setting out the amount to be transferred from each Member State's Structural Funds allocation to aid for the most deprived for the whole period. The Structural Funds allocation of each Member State shall be reduced accordingly, on the basis of a pro-rata reduction by category of region.

The annual appropriations corresponding to the support from the Structural Funds referred to in the first subparagraph shall be entered in the relevant budget lines of the aid for the most deprived instrument with the 2014 budgetary exercise.

8.   EUR 330 000 000 of the Structural Funds resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall be allocated to innovative actions under direct or indirect management by the Commission in the area of sustainable urban development.

9.   Resources for the European territorial cooperation goal shall amount to 2,75 % of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the Funds for the period 2014-2020 (i.e., a total of EUR 8 948 259 330).

10.   For the purposes of this Article, Articles 18, 91, 93, 95, 99, 120, Annex I and Annex X of this Regulation, Article 4 of the ERDF Regulation, Article 4 and Articles 16 to 23 of the ESF Regulation, Article 3(3) of the ETC Regulation, the outermost region of Mayotte shall be considered to be a NUTS level 2 region falling into the category of less developed regions. For the purposes of Article 3(1) and (2) of the ETC Regulation, the regions of Mayotte and Saint Martin shall be considered to be NUTS level 3 regions.

Article 93

Non-transferability of resources between categories of regions

1.   The total appropriations allocated to each Member State in respect of less developed regions, transition regions and more developed regions shall not be transferable between those categories of regions.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Commission may accept, in duly justified circumstances which are linked to the implementation of one or more thematic objectives, a proposal by a Member State in its first submission of the Partnership Agreement or, in duly justified circumstances, at the time of allocation of the performance reserve, or in a major revision of the Partnership Agreement, to transfer up to 3 % of the total appropriation for a category of regions to other categories of regions.

Article 94

Non-transferability of resources between goals

1.   The total appropriations allocated to each Member State in respect of the Investment for growth and jobs goal and the European territorial cooperation goal shall not be transferable between those goals.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Commission may in order to uphold the effective contribution of the Funds to the missions referred to in Article 89(1), in duly justified circumstances, and subject to the condition laid down in paragraph 3, accept by means of an implementing act a proposal by a Member State in its first submission of the Partnership Agreement to transfer a part of its appropriations for the European territorial cooperation goal to the Investment for growth and jobs goal.

3.   The share of the European territorial cooperation goal in the Member State making the proposal referred to in paragraph 2 shall be not less than 35 % of the total allocated to that Member State in respect of the Investment for growth and jobs goal and the European territorial cooperation goal, and after transfer shall be not less than 25 % of that total.

Article 95

Additionality

1.   For the purposes of this Article and Annex X, the following definitions apply:

  

(1)

'gross fixed capital formation' means all the resident producers' acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during a given period and certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of producer or institutional units, as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96[ (37)](#ntr37-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0037);

  

(2)

'fixed assets' means all tangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly, or continuously, in processes of production for more than one year;

  

(3)

'general government' means the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth;

  

(4)

'public or equivalent structural expenditure' means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government.

2.   Support from the Funds for the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall not replace public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State.

3.   Member States shall maintain for the period 2014-2020 a level of public or equivalent structural expenditure on average per year at least equal to the reference level set in the Partnership Agreement.

In setting the reference level referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission and the Member States shall take into account the general macroeconomic conditions and specific or exceptional circumstances, such as privatisations, an exceptional level of public or equivalent structural expenditure by a Member State in the 2007-2013 programming period and the evolution of other public investment indicators. They shall also take into account changes in the national allocations from the Funds as compared to the years 2007-2013.

4.   Verification of whether the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure under the Investment for growth and jobs goal has been maintained for the period shall only take place in those Member States in which less developed regions cover at least 15 % of the total population.

In those Member States in which less developed regions cover at least 65 % of the total population, the verification shall take place at national level.

In those Member States in which less developed regions cover more than 15 % and less than 65 % of the total population, the verification shall take place at regional level. For that purpose, those Member States shall provide to the Commission information about the expenditure in the less developed regions at each stage of the verification process.

5.   The verification of whether the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure under the Investment for growth and jobs goal has been maintained shall take place at the time of submission of the Partnership Agreement (the "ex ante verification"), in 2018 (the "mid-term verification"), and in 2022 (the "ex post verification").

The detailed rules relating to the verification of additionality are set out in point 2 of Annex X.

6.   If it is established by the Commission in the ex post verification that a Member State has not maintained the reference level of public or equivalent structural expenditure under the Investment for growth and jobs goal set out in the Partnership Agreement and as set out in Annex X, the Commission may, in relation to the degree of non-compliance, carry out a financial correction by adoption of a decision by means of implementing act. In determining whether to carry out a financial correction the Commission shall take into account whether the economic situation of the Member State has significantly changed since the mid-term verification. The detailed rules relating to financial correction rates are set out in point 3 of Annex X.

7.   Paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not apply to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal.

TITLE IV

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

Article 118

Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission

The Funds, taking into account the deductions made in accordance with Article 91(3), may support technical assistance up to a ceiling of 0,35 % of their respective annual allocation.

Article 119

Technical assistance of the Member States

1.   The amount of the Funds allocated to technical assistance shall be limited to 4 % of the total amount of the Funds allocated to operational programmes in a Member State under each category of region, where applicable, of the Investment for growth and jobs goal.

The specific allocation for YEI may be taken into account by a Member State in the calculation of the limit to the total amount of the Funds allocated to the technical assistance of the Member State.

2.   Each Fund may support technical assistance operations eligible under any of the other Funds. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the allocation for technical assistance from a Fund shall not exceed 10 % of the total allocation of that Fund to operational programmes in a Member State under each category of region, where applicable, of the Investment for growth and jobs goal.

3.   By way of derogation from Article 70(1) and (2), technical assistance operations may be implemented outside the programme area, but within the Union, provided that the operations are for the benefit of the operational programme, or, in the case of a technical assistance operational programme, for the other programmes concerned.

4.   In the case of the Structural Funds, where the allocations referred to in paragraph 1 are used to support technical assistance operations relating to more than one category of region, the expenditure relating to the operations may be implemented under a priority axis combining different categories of region and attributed on a pro rata basis taking into account the allocation under each category of region as a share of the total allocation to the Member State.

5.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, where the total amount of the Funds allocated to a Member State under the Investment for growth and jobs goal does not exceed EUR 1 000 000 000 the amount allocated to technical assistance may increase up to 6 % of that total amount or EUR 50 000 000, whichever is the lower.

6.   Technical assistance shall take the form of a mono-fund priority axis within an operational programme or of a specific operational programme, or both.

TITLE V

FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE FUNDS

Article 120

Determination of co-financing rates

1.   The Commission decision adopting an operational programme shall fix the co-financing rate and the maximum amount of support from Funds for each priority axis. Where a priority axis concerns more than one category of regions or more than one Fund, the Commission decision shall, where necessary, fix the co-financing rate by category of region and Fund.

2.   For each priority axis, the Commission decision shall set out whether the co-financing rate for the priority axis is to be applied to:

  

(a)

total eligible expenditure, including public and private expenditure; or

  

(b)

eligible public expenditure.

3.   The co-financing rate at the level of each priority axis and, where relevant, by category of region and Fund, of operational programmes under the Investment for growth and jobs goal shall be no higher than:

  

(a)

85 % for the Cohesion Fund;

  

(b)

85 % for the less developed regions of Member States whose average GDP per capita for the period 2007 - 2009 was below 85 % of the EU-27 average during the same period and for the outermost regions including the additional allocation for outermost regions in accordance with point (e) of Article 92(1) and Article 4(2) of the ETC Regulation;

  

(c)

80 % for the less developed regions of Member States other than those referred to in point (b), and for all regions whose GDP per capita used as an eligibility criterion for the 2007-2013 programming period was less than 75 % of the average of the EU-25 but whose GDP per capita is above 75 % of the GDP average of the EU-27, as well as for regions defined in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) 1083/2006 receiving transitional support for the 2007-2013 programming period;

  

(d)

60 % for the transition regions other than those referred to in point (c);

  

(e)

50 % for the more developed regions other than those referred to in point (c).

For the period from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2017 the co-financing rate at the level of each priority axis for all operational programmes in Cyprus shall be not higher than 85 %.

The Commission shall carry out a review to assess the justification for maintaining the co-financing rate, referred to in the second subparagraph, after 30 June 2017 and shall if necessary make a legislative proposal before 30 June 2016.

The co-financing rate at the level of each priority axis of operational programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal shall be no higher than 85 %.

The maximum co-financing rate under points (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph shall be increased for each priority axis implementing the YEI and where a priority axis is dedicated to social innovation or to transnational cooperation, or a combination of both. That increase shall be determined in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

4.   The co-financing rate of the additional allocation in accordance with point (e) of Article 92(1) shall be no higher than 50 % for NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession.

5.   The maximum co-financing rate under paragraph 3 at the level of a priority axis shall be increased by ten percentage points, where the whole of a priority axis is delivered through financial instruments, or through community-led local development.

6.   The contribution from the Funds for each priority axis shall not be less than 20 % of the eligible public expenditure.

7.   A separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100 % may be established within an operational programme to support operations implemented through financial instruments set up at Union level and managed directly or indirectly by the Commission. Where a separate priority axis is established for this purpose, the support under this axis may not be implemented by any other means.

Article 121

Modulation of the co-financing rates

The co-financing rate from the Funds to a priority axis may be modulated to take account of:

  

(1)

the importance of the priority axis for the delivery of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, having regard to the specific gaps to be addressed;

  

(2)

the protection and improvement of the environment, principally through the application of the precautionary principle, the principle of preventive action and the polluter pays principle;

  

(3)

the rate of mobilisation of private financing;

  

(4)

the coverage of areas with severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps defined as follows:

island Member States eligible under the Cohesion Fund, and other islands except those on which the capital of a Member State is situated or which have a fixed link to the mainland;

  

(b)

mountainous areas as defined by the national legislation of the Member State;

  

(c)

sparsely (i.e. less than 50 inhabitants per square kilometre) and very sparsely (less than 8 inhabitants per square kilometre) populated areas;

  

(d)

the inclusion of the outermost regions as referred to in Article 349 TFEU.

PART FOUR

GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE FUNDS AND THE EMFF

TITLE I

MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL

CHAPTER I

Management and control systems

Article 122

Responsibilities of Member States

1.   Member States shall ensure that management and control systems for operational programmes are set up in accordance with Articles 72, 73 and 74.

2.   Member States shall prevent, detect and correct irregularities and shall recover amounts unduly paid, together with any interest on late payments. They shall notify the Commission of irregularities that exceed EUR 10 000 in contribution from the Funds and shall keep it informed of significant progress in related administrative and legal proceedings.

The Member States shall not notify the Commission of irregularities in relation to the following:

  

(a)

cases where the irregularity consists solely of the failure to execute, in whole or in part, an operation included in the co-financed operational programme owing to the bankruptcy of the beneficiary;

  

(b)

cases brought to the attention of the managing authority or certifying authority by the beneficiary voluntarily and before detection by either authority, whether before or after the payment of the public contribution;

  

(c)

cases which are detected and corrected by the managing authority or certifying authority before inclusion of the expenditure concerned in a statement of expenditure submitted to the Commission.

In all other cases, in particular those preceding a bankruptcy or in cases of suspected fraud, the detected irregularities and the associated preventive and corrective measures shall be reported to the Commission.

When amounts unduly paid to a beneficiary cannot be recovered and this is as a result of fault or negligence on the part of a Member State, the Member State shall be responsible for reimbursing the amounts concerned to the budget of the Union. Member States may decide not to recover an amount unduly paid if the amount to be recovered from the beneficiary, not including interest, does not exceed EUR 250 in contribution from the Funds.

The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149 laying down additional detailed rules on the criteria for determining the cases of irregularity to be reported, the data to be provided and on the conditions and procedures to be applied to determine whether amounts which are irrecoverable shall be reimbursed by Member States.

The Commission shall adopt implementing acts setting out the frequency of the reporting of irregularities and the reporting format to be used. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 150(2).

3.   Member States shall ensure that no later than 31 December 2015, all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and a managing authority, a certifying authority, an audit authority and intermediate bodies can be carried out by means of electronic data exchange systems.

The systems referred to in the first subparagraph shall facilitate interoperability with national and Union frameworks and allow for the beneficiaries to submit all information referred to in the first subparagraph only once.

The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down detailed rules concerning the exchanges of information under this paragraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

4.   Paragraph 3 shall not apply to the EMFF.

CHAPTER II

Management and control authorities

Article 123

Designation of authorities

1.   Each Member State shall designate, for each operational programme, a national, regional or local public authority or body or a private body as managing authority. The same managing authority may be designated for more than one operational programme.

2.   The Member State shall designate, for each operational programme, a national, regional or local public authority or body as a certifying authority, without prejudice to paragraph 3. The same certifying authority may be designated for more than one operational programme.

3.   The Member State may designate for an operational programme a managing authority, which is a public authority or body, to carry out, in addition, the functions of the certifying authority.

4.   The Member State shall designate, for each operational programme, a national, regional or local public authority or body, functionally independent from the managing authority and the certifying authority, as audit authority. The same audit authority may be designated for more than one operational programme.

5.   In the case of the Funds relating to the Investment for growth and jobs goal and in the case of the EMFF, provided that the principle of separation of functions is respected, the managing authority, the certifying authority, where applicable, and the audit authority may be part of the same public authority or body.

Where the total amount of support from the Funds to an operational programme exceeds EUR 250 000 000 or from the EMFF exceeds EUR 100 000 000, the audit authority may be part of the same public authority or body as the managing authority either if, pursuant to the applicable provisions for the previous programming period, the Commission has informed the Member State prior to the date of adoption of the operational programme concerned of its conclusion that it can rely principally on its audit opinion, or if the Commission is satisfied on the basis of the experience of the previous programming period that the institutional organisation and accountability of the audit authority provide adequate guarantees of its functional independence and reliability.

6.   The Member State may designate one or more intermediate bodies to carry out certain tasks of the managing or the certifying authority under the responsibility of that authority. The relevant arrangements between the managing authority or certifying authority and the intermediate bodies shall be formally recorded in writing.

7.   The Member State or the managing authority may entrust the management of part of an operational programme to an intermediate body by way of an agreement in writing between the intermediate body and the Member State or managing authority (a 'global grant'). The intermediate body shall provide guarantees of its solvency and competence in the domain concerned, as well as of its administrative and financial management capacity.

8.   The Member State may, at its own initiative, designate a coordinating body whose responsibility shall be to liaise with and provide information to the Commission, to coordinate activities of the other relevant designated bodies and to promote the harmonised application of applicable law.

9.   The Member State shall lay down in writing rules governing its relationship with the managing authorities, certifying authorities and audit authorities, the relations between such authorities, and the relationship of such authorities with the Commission.

Article 124

Procedure for the designation of the managing authority and the certifying authority

1.   The Member State shall notify the Commission of the date and form of the designations, which shall be carried out at an appropriate level, of the managing authority and, where appropriate, of the certifying authority prior to the submission of the first application for interim payment to the Commission.

2.   The designations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on a report and an opinion of an independent audit body that assesses the fulfilment by the authorities of the criteria relating to the internal control environment, risk management, management and control activities, and monitoring set out in Annex XIII. The independent audit body shall be the audit authority, or another public or private law body with the necessary audit capacity, which is independent of the managing authority and, where applicable, of the certifying authority, and which shall carry out its work taking account of internationally accepted audit standards. Where the independent audit body concludes that the part of the management and control system, concerning the managing authority or the certifying authority, is essentially the same as for the previous programming period, and that there is evidence, on the basis of audit work done in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006[ (38)](#ntr38-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0038), of their effective functioning during that period, it may conclude that the relevant criteria are fulfilled without carrying out additional audit work.

3.   Where the total amount of support from the Funds to an operational programme exceeds EUR 250 000 000 or from the EMFF exceeds EUR 100 000 000, the Commission may request, within one month of notification of the designations referred to in paragraph 1, the report and the opinion of the independent audit body referred to in paragraph 2 and the description of the functions and procedures in place for the managing authority or, where appropriate, the certifying authority. The Commission shall decide whether to request those documents on the basis of its risk assessment, taking into account information on significant changes in the functions and procedures of the managing authority or, where appropriate, the certifying authority compared to those in place for the previous programming period, and relevant evidence of their effective functioning.

The Commission may make observations within two months of receipt of the documents referred to in the first subparagraph. Without prejudice to Article 83, the examination of those documents shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments.

4.   Where the total amount of support from the Funds to an operational programme exceeds EUR 250 000 000 or from the EMFF exceeds EUR 100 000 000 and there are significant changes in the functions and procedures of the managing authority or, where appropriate, of the certifying authority compared to those in place for the previous programming period, the Member State may, at its own initiative, submit to the Commission, within two months of the notification of the designations referred to in paragraph 1, the documents referred to in paragraph 3. The Commission shall make observations on those documents within three months of their receipt.

5.   Where existing audit and control results show that the designated authority no longer fulfils the criteria referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State shall, at an appropriate level, fix, according to the severity of the problem, a period of probation, during which the necessary remedial action shall be taken.

Where the designated authority fails to implement the required remedial action within the period of probation determined by the Member State, the Member State, at an appropriate level, shall end its designation.

The Member State shall notify the Commission without delay when a designated authority is put under probation, providing information on the respective period of probation, when, following implementation of remedial actions, the probation is ended, as well as when the designation of an authority is ended. The notification that a designated body is put on probation by the Member State, without prejudice to the application of Article 83, shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments.

6.   Where the designation of a managing authority or a certifying authority is ended, Member States shall designate, in accordance with the procedure provided for in paragraph 2, a new body, to take over the functions of the managing authority or of the certifying authority, and shall notify the Commission thereof.

7.   The Commission shall, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt implementing acts concerning the model for the report and opinion of the independent audit body and the description of the functions and procedures in place for the managing authority and, where appropriate, the certifying authority. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

5.   Each payment application which includes advances of the type referred to in paragraph 4 shall separately disclose the total amount paid from the operational programme as advances, the amount which has been covered by expenditure paid by beneficiaries within three years of the payment of the advance in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 4, and the amount which has not been covered by expenditure paid by beneficiaries and for which the three year period has not yet elapsed.

6.   The Commission shall, in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt implementing acts laying down the model for payment applications. These implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

Article 132

Payment to beneficiaries

1.   Subject to the availability of funding from initial and annual pre-financing and interim payments, the managing authority shall ensure that a beneficiary receives the total amount of eligible public expenditure due in full and no later than 90 days from the date of submission of the payment claim by the beneficiary.

No amount shall be deducted or withheld and no specific charge or other charge with equivalent effect shall be levied that would reduce amounts due to beneficiaries.

2.   The payment deadline referred to in paragraph 1 may be interrupted by the managing authority in either of the following duly justified cases:

The exchange rate shall be published electronically by the Commission each month.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the ETC Regulation may establish specific rules on the timing for conversion into euro.

3.   When the euro becomes the currency of a Member State, the conversion procedure set out in paragraph 1 shall continue to apply to all expenditure recorded in the accounts by the certifying authority before the date of entry into force of the fixed conversion rate between the national currency and the euro.

Article 135

Deadlines for presentation of interim payment applications and for their payment

1.   The certifying authority shall submit on a regular basis an application for interim payment in accordance with Article 131(1) covering amounts entered in its accounting system in the accounting year. However, the certifying authority, where it considers it to be necessary, may include such amounts in payment applications submitted in subsequent accounting years.

2.   The certifying authority shall submit the final application for an interim payment by 31 July following the end of the previous accounting year and, in any event, before the first application for interim payment for the next accounting year.

3.   The first application for interim payment shall not be made before the notification to the Commission of the designation of the managing authorities and certifying authorities in accordance with Article 124.

4.   Interim payments shall not be made for an operational programme unless the annual implementation report has been sent to the Commission in accordance with the Fund-specific rules.

5.   Subject to available funding, the Commission shall make the interim payment no later than 60 days after the date on which a payment application is registered with the Commission.

Article 136

2.   That part of commitments still open on 31 December 2023 shall be decommitted if any of the documents required under Article 141(1) has not been submitted to the Commission by the deadline set out in Article 141(1).

CHAPTER II

Preparation, examination and acceptance of accounts and closure of operational programmes and suspension of payments

Section I

Preparation, examination and acceptance of accounts

Article 137

Preparation of the accounts

1.   The accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation shall be submitted to the Commission for each operational programme. The accounts shall cover the accounting year and shall include at the level of each priority and, where applicable, fund and category of regions:

  

(a)

the total amount of eligible expenditure entered into the accounting systems of the certifying authority which has been included in payment applications submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 131 and Article 135(2) by 31 July following the end of the accounting year, the total amount of the corresponding public expenditure incurred in implementing operations, and the total amount of corresponding payments made to beneficiaries under Article 132(1);

  

(b)

the amounts withdrawn and recovered during the accounting year, the amounts to be recovered as at the end of the accounting year, the recoveries effected pursuant to Article 71, and the irrecoverable amounts;

  

(c)

the amounts of programme contributions paid to financial instruments under Article 41(1) and advances of State aid under Article 131(4);

  

(d)

for each priority, a reconciliation between the expenditure stated pursuant to point (a) and the expenditure declared in respect of the same accounting year in payment applications, accompanied by an explanation of any differences.

2.   Where expenditure previously included in an application for interim payment for the accounting year is excluded by a Member State from its accounts due to an ongoing assessment of that expenditure's legality and regularity, any or all of that expenditure subsequently found to be legal and regular may be included in an application for interim payment relating to subsequent accounting years.

3.   The Commission shall, in order to lay down uniform conditions for the implementation of this Article, adopt implementing acts setting out the model for the accounts referred to in this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 150(3).

Article 138

Submission of information

For each year from 2016 until and including 2025, Member States shall submit, by the deadline set out in Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation, the documents referred to in that Article namely:

  

(a)

the accounts, referred to in Article 137(1) of this Regulation, for the preceding accounting year;

  

(b)

the management declaration and the annual summary referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(4) of this Regulation, for the preceding accounting year;

  

(c)

the audit opinion and the control report referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 127(5) of this Regulation, for the preceding accounting year.

Article 139

Examination and acceptance of accounts

1.   The Commission shall carry out an examination of the documents submitted by the Member State under Article 138. Upon request by the Commission, the Member State shall provide all necessary additional information to enable the Commission to determine whether the accounts are complete, accurate and true, by the deadline set out in Article 84.

2.   The Commission shall accept the accounts where it is able to conclude that the accounts are complete, accurate and true. The Commission shall reach such a conclusion where the audit authority has provided an unqualified audit opinion regarding the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the accounts unless the Commission has specific evidence that the audit opinion on the accounts is unreliable.

3.   The Commission shall inform the Member State by the deadline set out in Article 84 as to whether it is able to accept the accounts.

4.   If, for reasons attributable to Member State, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts by the deadline set out in Article 84, the Commission shall notify the Member States specifying the reasons in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and the actions which are required to be undertaken and the time period for their completion. At the end of the time period for the completion of those actions the Commission shall inform the Member State as to whether it is able to accept the accounts.

5.   Issues related to legality and regularity of the underlying transactions concerning expenditure entered in the accounts shall not be taken into account for the purposes of acceptance of the accounts by the Commission. The procedure for examination and acceptance of the accounts shall not interrupt the treatment of applications for interim payments and shall not lead to suspension of payments, without prejudice to Articles 83 and 142.

6.   On the basis of the accepted accounts, the Commission shall calculate the amount chargeable to the Funds and to the EMFF for the accounting year and the consequent adjustments in relation to the payments to the Member State. The Commission shall take into account:

  

(a)

the amounts in the accounts referred to in point (a) of Article 137(1) and to which the co-financing rate for each priority is to be applied;

  

(b)

the total amount of payments made by the Commission during that accounting year, consisting of:

  

(i)

the amount of interim payments paid by the Commission in accordance with Article 130(1) and Article 24; and

  

(ii)

the amount of the annual pre-financing paid under Article 134(2).

7.   After the calculation carried out under paragraph 6, the Commission shall clear the respective annual pre-financing and pay any additional amount due within 30 days of the acceptance of the accounts. Where there is an amount recoverable from the Member State, it shall be subject to a recovery order issued by the Commission which shall be executed, where possible, by offsetting against amounts due to the Member State under subsequent payments to the same operational programme. Such recovery shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds to the operational programme. The amount recovered shall constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 177(3) of the Financial Regulation.

8.   Where, after applying the procedure set out in paragraph 4, the Commission is unable to accept the accounts, the Commission shall determine, on the basis of the available information and in accordance with paragraph 6, the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year, and shall inform the Member State. Where the Member State notifies the Commission of its agreement within two months of the transmission by the Commission of the information, paragraph 7 shall apply. In the absence of such agreement, the Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of implementing acts, setting out the amount chargeable to the Funds for the accounting year. Such decision shall not constitute a financial correction and shall not reduce support from the Funds to the operational programme. On the basis of the decision, the Commission shall apply the adjustments to the payments to the Member State in accordance with paragraph 7.

9.   The acceptance of the accounts by the Commission, or a decision by the Commission under paragraph 8 of this Article, shall be without prejudice to the application of corrections under Articles 144 and 145.

10.   Member States may replace irregular amounts which are detected after the submission of the accounts by making the corresponding adjustments in the accounts for the accounting year in which the irregularity is detected, without prejudice to Articles 144 and 145.

Article 140

Availability of documents

1.   Without prejudice to the rules governing State aid, the managing authority shall ensure that all supporting documents regarding expenditure supported by the Funds on operations for which the total eligible expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000, are made available to the Commission and the European Court of Auditors upon request for a period of three years from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the expenditure of the operation is included.

In the case of operations other than those referred to in the first subparagraph, all supporting documents shall be made available for a two year period from 31 December following the submission of the accounts in which the final expenditure of the completed operation is included.

A managing authority may decide to apply to operations for which the total eligible expenditure is less than EUR 1 000 000 the rule referred to in the second subparagraph.

The time period referred to in the first subparagraph shall be interrupted either in the case of legal proceedings or by a duly justified request of the Commission.

2.   The managing authority shall inform beneficiaries of the start date of the period referred to in paragraph 1.

3.   The documents shall be kept either in the form of the originals, or certified true copies of the originals, or on commonly accepted data carriers including electronic versions of original documents or documents existing in electronic version only.

4.   The documents shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed.

5.   The procedure for certification of conformity of documents held on commonly accepted data carriers with the original document shall be laid down by the national authorities and shall ensure that the versions held comply with national legal requirements and can be relied on for audit purposes.

6.   Where documents exist in electronic form only, the computer systems used shall meet accepted security standards that ensure that the documents held comply with national legal requirements and can be relied on for audit purposes.

Section II

Closure of operational programmes

Article 141

Submission of closure documents and payment of the final balance

1.   In addition to the documents referred to in Article 138, for the final accounting year from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, Member States shall submit a final implementation report for the operational programme or the last annual implementation report for the operational programme supported by the EMFF.

2.   The final balance shall be paid no later than three months after the date of acceptance of accounts of the final accounting year or one month after the date of acceptance of the final implementation report, whichever date is later.

Section III

Suspension of payments

Article 142

Suspension of payments

1.   All or part of the interim payments at the level of priorities or operational programmes may be suspended by the Commission if one or more of the following conditions are met:

  

(a)

there is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme, which has put at risk the Union contribution to the operational programme and for which corrective measures have not been taken;

  

(b)

expenditure in a statement of expenditure is linked to an irregularity having serious financial consequences which has not been corrected;

  

(c)

the Member State has failed to take the necessary action to remedy the situation giving rise to an interruption under Article 83;

  

(d)

there is a serious deficiency in the quality and reliability of the monitoring system or of the data on common and specific indicators;

  

(e)

there is a failure to complete actions to fulfil an ex ante conditionality subject to the conditions set out in Article 19;

  

(f)

there is evidence resulting from the performance review for a priority that there has been a serious failure in achieving that priority's milestones relating to financial and output indicators and key implementation steps set out in the performance framework subject to the conditions set out in Article 22.

The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for suspension of payments linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance.

2.   The Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts, to suspend all or part of interim payments, after having given the Member State the opportunity to present its observations.

3.   The Commission shall end suspension of all or part of interim payments where the Member State has taken the necessary measures to enable the suspension to be lifted.

CHAPTER III

Financial corrections

Section I

Financial corrections by Member States

Article 143

Financial corrections by Member States

1.   The Member States shall in the first instance be responsible for investigating irregularities and for making the financial corrections required and pursuing recoveries. In the case of a systemic irregularity, the Member State shall extend its investigation to cover all operations potentially affected.

2.   Member States shall make the financial corrections required in connection with individual or systemic irregularities detected in operations or operational programmes. Financial corrections shall consist of cancelling all or part of the public contribution to an operation or operational programme. The Member States shall take into account the nature and gravity of the irregularities and the financial loss to the Funds or the EMFF and shall apply a proportionate correction. Financial corrections shall be recorded in the accounts by the managing authority for the accounting year in which the cancellation is decided.

3.   The contribution from the Funds or the EMFF cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may be reused by the Member State within the operational programme concerned, subject to paragraph 4.

4.   The contribution cancelled in accordance with paragraph 2 may not be reused for any operation that was the subject of the correction or, where a financial correction is made for a systemic irregularity, for any operation affected by the systemic irregularity.

5.   The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Member States linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy, which shall be proportionate, having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance.

Section II

Financial corrections by the Commission

Article 144

Criteria for financial corrections

1.   The Commission shall make financial corrections, by means of implementing acts, by cancelling all or part of the Union contribution to an operational programme in accordance with Article 85, where, after carrying out the necessary examination, it concludes that:

  

(a)

there is a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme which has put at risk the Union contribution already paid to the operational programme;

  

(b)

the Member State has not complied with its obligations under Article 143 prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph;

  

(c)

expenditure contained in a payment application is irregular and has not been corrected by the Member State prior to the opening of the correction procedure under this paragraph.

The Commission shall base its financial corrections on individual cases of identified irregularity and shall take account of whether an irregularity is systemic. Where it is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of irregular expenditure charged to the Funds or the EMFF, the Commission shall apply a flat rate or extrapolated financial correction.

2.   The Commission shall, when deciding on a correction under paragraph 1, respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the irregularity and the extent and financial implications of the deficiencies in management and control systems found in the operational programme.

3.   Where the Commission bases its position on reports of auditors other than those of its own services, it shall draw its own conclusions regarding the financial consequences after examining the measures taken by the Member State concerned under Article 143(2), the notifications sent under Article 122(2), and any replies from the Member State.

4.   In accordance with Article 22(7), where the Commission, based on the examination of the final implementation report of the operational programme for the Funds or the last annual implementation report for the EMFF, establishes a serious failure to achieve the targets set out in the performance framework, it may apply financial corrections in respect of the priorities concerned, by means of implementing acts.

5.   When a Member State does not comply with its obligations under Article 95, the Commission may, in relation to the degree of non-compliance with those obligations, make a financial correction by cancelling all or part of the Structural Funds contribution to the Member State concerned.

6.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 149, laying down detailed rules concerning the criteria for determining serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems, including the main types of such deficiencies, the criteria for establishing the level of financial correction to be applied and the criteria for applying flat rates or extrapolated financial corrections.

7.   The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down specific bases for financial corrections by the Commission linked to non-compliance with rules applicable under the Common Fisheries Policy which shall be proportionate having regard to the nature, gravity, duration and recurrence of the non-compliance.

Article 145

Procedure

1.   Before taking a decision on a financial correction, the Commission shall launch the procedure by informing the Member State of the provisional conclusions of its examination and requesting the Member State to submit its comments within two months.

2.   Where the Commission proposes a financial correction on the basis of extrapolation or a flat rate, the Member State shall be given the opportunity to demonstrate, through an examination of the documentation concerned, that the actual extent of irregularity is less than the Commission's assessment. In agreement with the Commission, the Member State may limit the scope of this examination to an appropriate proportion or sample of the documentation concerned. Except in duly justified cases, the time allowed for that examination shall not exceed a further period of two months after the two-month period referred to in paragraph 1.

3.   The Commission shall take account of any evidence provided by the Member State within the time limits set out in paragraphs 1 and 2.

4.   Where the Member State does not accept the provisional conclusions of the Commission, the Member State shall be invited to a hearing by the Commission, in order to ensure that all relevant information and observations are available as a basis for conclusions by the Commission on the application of the financial correction.

5.   In the event of an agreement, and without prejudice to paragraph 6 of this Article, the Member State may reuse the Funds concerned in accordance with Article 143(3).

6.   In order to apply financial corrections the Commission shall take a decision, by means of implementing acts, within six months of the date of the hearing, or of the date of receipt of additional information where the Member State agrees to submit such additional information following the hearing. The Commission shall take account of all information and observations submitted during the course of the procedure. If no hearing takes place, the six month period shall begin to run two months after the date of the letter of invitation to the hearing sent by the Commission.

7.   Where the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under Article 75, or the European Court of Auditors, detects irregularities demonstrating a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of the management and control systems, the resulting financial correction shall reduce support from the Funds to the operational programme.

The first subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a serious deficiency in the effective functioning of a management and control system which, prior to the date of detection by the Commission or the European Court of Auditors:

  

(a)

had been identified in the management declaration, annual control report or the audit opinion submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 59(5) of the Financial Regulation, or in other audit reports of the audit authority submitted to the Commission and appropriate measures taken; or

  

(b)

had been the subject of appropriate remedial measures by the Member State.

The assessment of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of management and control systems shall be based on the applicable law when the relevant management declarations, annual control reports and audit opinions were submitted.

When deciding on a financial correction the Commission shall:

  

(a)

respect the principle of proportionality by taking account of the nature and gravity of the serious deficiency in the effective functioning of a management and control system and its financial implications for the budget of the Union;

  

(b)

for the purpose of applying a flat rate or extrapolated correction, exclude irregular expenditure previously detected by the Member State which has been the subject of an adjustment in the accounts in accordance with Article 139(10), and expenditure subject to an ongoing assessment of its legality and regularity under Article 137(2);

  

(c)

take into account flat rate or extrapolated corrections applied to the expenditure by the Member State for other serious deficiencies detected by the Member State when determining the residual risk for the budget of the Union.

8.   The Fund-specific rules for the EMFF may lay down additional rules of procedure for financial corrections referred to in Article 144(7).

Article 146

Obligations of Member States

A financial correction by the Commission shall not prejudice the Member State's obligation to pursue recoveries under Article 143(2) of this Regulation and to recover State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU and under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999[ (39)](#ntr39-L_2013347EN.01032001-E0039).

Article 147

Repayment

1.   Any repayment due to be made to the budget of the Union shall be effected before the due date indicated in the order for recovery drawn up in accordance with Article 73 of the Financial Regulation. The due date shall be the last day of the second month following the issuing of the order.

2.   Any delay in effecting repayment shall give rise to interest on account of late payment, starting on the due date and ending on the date of actual payment. The rate of such interest shall be one-and-a-half percentage points above the rate applied by the European Central Bank in its main refinancing operations on the first working day of the month in which the due date falls.

TITLE III

PROPORTIONAL CONTROL OF OPERATIONAL PROGRAMMES

Article 148

Proportional control of operational programmes

1.   Operations for which the total eligible expenditure does not exceed EUR 200 000 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, EUR 150 000 for the ESF or EUR 100 000 for the EMFF shall not be subject to more than one audit by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Other operations shall not be subject to more than one audit per accounting year by either the audit authority or the Commission prior to the submission of the accounts for the accounting year in which the operation is completed. Operations shall not be subject to an audit by the Commission or the audit authority in any year if there has already been an audit in that year by the European Court of Auditors, provided that the results of the audit work performed by the European Court of Auditors for such operations can be used by the audit authority or the Commission for the purpose of fulfilling their respective tasks.

2.   For operational programmes for which the most recent audit opinion indicates that there are no significant deficiencies, the Commission may agree with the audit authority in the subsequent meeting referred to in Article 128(3) that the level of audit work required may be reduced so that it is proportionate to the risk established. In such cases, the Commission shall not carry out its own on-the-spot audits unless there is evidence suggesting deficiencies in the management and control system affecting expenditure declared to the Commission in an accounting year for which the accounts have been accepted by the Commission.

3.   For operational programmes for which the Commission concludes that the opinion of the audit authority is reliable, it may agree with the audit authority to limit the Commission's own on-the-spot audits to audit the work of the audit authority unless there is evidence of deficiencies in the work of the audit authority for an accounting year for which the accounts have been accepted by the Commission.

4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the audit authority and the Commission may carry out audits of operations in the event that a risk assessment or an audit by the European Court of Auditors establishes a specific risk of irregularity or fraud, in the case of evidence of serious deficiencies in the effective functioning of the management and control system of the operational programme concerned, and, during the period referred to in Article 140(1). The Commission may, for the purpose of assessing the work of an audit authority, review the audit trail of the audit authority or take part in the on-the-spot audits of the audit authority and, where, in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards, it is necessary for the purpose of obtaining assurance as to the effective functioning of the audit authority, the Commission may carry out audits of operations.

ANNEX I

COMMON STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

1.   INTRODUCTION

In order to promote the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the Union and to maximise the contribution of the ESI Funds to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth as well as the Fund-specific missions of the ESI Funds, including economic, social and territorial cohesion, it is necessary to ensure that policy commitments made in the context of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth are underpinned by investment through the ESI Funds and other Union instruments. The Common Strategic Framework (CSF) shall therefore, in accordance with Article 10, and in compliance with the priorities and objectives laid down in the Fund-specific Regulations, provide strategic guiding principles in order to achieve an integrated development approach using the ESI Funds coordinated with other Union instruments and policies, in line with the policy objectives and headline targets of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and, where appropriate, the flagship initiatives, while taking into account the key territorial challenges and specific national, regional and local contexts.

2.   CONTRIBUTION OF ESI FUNDS TO THE UNION STRATEGY FOR SMART, SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND COHERENCE WITH THE UNION'S ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE

  

1.

To support effective targeting of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the Partnership Agreements and programmes this Regulation identifies eleven thematic objectives, set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, corresponding to the priorities of the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth which shall receive support from the ESI Funds.

  

2.

In line with the thematic objectives set out in the first paragraph of Article 9, Member States shall, in order to ensure critical mass necessary to deliver growth and jobs, concentrate support in accordance with Article 18 of this Regulation and with the Fund-specific rules on thematic concentration, and shall ensure the effectiveness of spending. Member States shall give particular attention to prioritising growth-friendly expenditure, including spending on education, research, innovation and energy efficiency and expenditure to facilitate the access of SMEs to finance, and to ensure environmental sustainability, and the management of natural resources and climate action as well as to modernise public administration. They shall also take account of maintaining or reinforcing the coverage and effectiveness of employment services and active labour market policies in order to combat unemployment, with a focus on youth and tackle the social consequences of the crisis, and promote social inclusion.

  

3.

To ensure consistency with priorities established in the context of the European Semester, in preparing their Partnership Agreements, Member States shall plan the use of the ESI Funds taking into account the National Reform Programmes, where appropriate, and the most recent relevant country-specific recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 121(2) TFEU and relevant Council recommendations adopted in accordance with Article 148(4) TFEU in accordance with their respective roles and obligations. Member States, where necessary, shall also take into account relevant Council recommendations based on the Stability and Growth Pact and the economic adjustment programmes.

  

4.

In order to determine the way in which the ESI Funds can most effectively contribute to the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and to take account of the Treaty objectives, including economic, social and territorial cohesion, Member States shall select the thematic objectives for the planned use of the ESI Funds within the appropriate national, regional and local contexts.

3.   INTEGRATED APPROACH TO AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE USE OF THE ESI FUNDS

3.1   Introduction

Member States shall seek to make maximum use of the possibilities for ensuring coordinated and integrated delivery of the ESI funds.

  

2.

Member States and, where appropriate in accordance with Article 4(4), regions shall ensure that the interventions supported through the ESI Funds are complementary and are implemented in a coordinated manner with a view to creating synergies, in order to reduce the administrative cost and burden for managing bodies and beneficiaries in accordance with Articles 4, 15 and 27.

3.2   Coordination and complementarity

  

1.

promote common approaches between ESI Funds with regard to guidance for the development of operations, calls for proposals and selection processes or other mechanisms to facilitate access to Funds for integrated projects;

  

(h)

encourage cooperation between managing authorities of different ESI Funds in the areas of monitoring, evaluation, management and control, and audit.

3.3   Encouraging integrated approaches

  

1.

Member States shall, where appropriate, combine the ESI Funds into integrated packages at local, regional or national level, which are tailor-made to address specific territorial challenges in order to support the achievement of the objectives set out in the Partnership Agreement and programmes. This can be done using ITIs, Integrated operations, Joint Action Plans and community-led local development.

  

2.

In accordance with Article 36 to achieve integrated use of thematic objectives, funding from different priority axes or operational programmes supported by the ESF, ERDF and Cohesion Fund may be combined under an ITI. Actions carried out under an ITI may be complemented with financial support from the programmes under the EAFRD or the EMFF respectively.

  

3.

In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Fund-specific rules, to increase impact and effectiveness in a thematically coherent integrated approach a priority axis may concern more than one category of region, combine one or more complementary investment priorities from the ERDF, Cohesion Fund and ESF under one thematic objective and, in duly justified cases combine one or more complementary investment priorities from different thematic objectives in order to achieve the maximum contribution to that priority axis.

  

4.

Member States shall promote, in accordance with their institutional and legal framework and with Article 32 the development of local and sub-regional approaches. Community-led local development shall be implemented in the context of a strategic approach to ensure that the 'bottom-up' definition of local needs takes account of priorities set at a higher level. Member States shall therefore define the approach to community-led local development in the EAFRD and, where appropriate, in the ERDF, the ESF or the EMFF in accordance with Article 15(2) and shall indicate in the Partnership Agreement the main challenges to be tackled in this way, the main objectives and priorities for community-led local development, the types of territories to be covered, the specific role to be attributed to local action groups in the delivery of strategies and the role envisaged for the EAFRD and where appropriate for the ERDF, the ESF or the EMFF in implementing community-led local development strategies in different types of territories such as rural, urban and coastal areas and the corresponding co-ordination mechanisms.

4.   COORDINATION AND SYNERGIES BETWEEN ESI FUNDS AND OTHER UNION POLICIES AND INSTRUMENTS

Coordination by Member States as envisaged under this section shall apply in so far as a Member State intends to make use of support from the ESI Funds and other Union instruments in the relevant policy area. The Union programmes set out in this section do not constitute an exhaustive list.

4.1   Introduction

ANNEX III

PROVISIONS FOR DETERMINING THE SCOPE AND THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSION OF COMMITMENTS OR PAYMENTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 23(11)

1.   DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSION OF COMMITMENTS

The maximum level of suspension applied to a Member State shall in the first instance be determined taking into account the ceilings set out in points (a) to (c) of the third subparagraph of Article 23(11). That level shall be reduced if one or more of the following apply:

  

(a)

where the unemployment rate in the Member State for the year preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9) exceeds the average rate for the Union by more than two percentage points, the maximum level of suspension shall be reduced by 15 %;

  

(b)

where the unemployment rate in the Member State for the year preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9) exceeds the average rate for the Union by more than five percentage points, the maximum level of suspension shall be reduced by 25 %;

  

(c)

where the unemployment rate in the Member State for the year preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9) exceeds the average rate for the Union by more than eight percentage points, the maximum level of suspension shall be reduced by 50 %;

  

(d)

where the proportion of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the Member State exceeds the average for the Union by more than 10 percentage points for the year preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9), the maximum level of suspension shall be reduced by 20 %;

  

(e)

where the Member State experiences a contraction of real GDP for two or more consecutive years preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9), the maximum level of suspension shall be reduced by 20 %;

  

(f)

where the suspension concerns commitments for the years 2018, 2019 or 2020, a reduction shall be applied to the level resulting from the application of Article 23(11) as follows:

  

(i)

for the year 2018, the level of suspension shall be reduced by 15 %;

  

(ii)

for the year 2019, the level of suspension shall be reduced by 25 %;

  

(iii)

for the year 2020, the level of suspension shall be reduced by 50 %.

The reduction in the level of suspension resulting from the application of points (a) to (f) shall not exceed in total 50 %.

In the event that the situation described in point (b) or (c) occurs simultaneously with both points (d) and (e), the effect of the suspension shall be postponed by one year.

2.   DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF SUSPENSION OF COMMITMENTS ACROSS PROGRAMMES AND PRIORITIES

A suspension of commitments applied to a Member State shall in the first instance proportionally affect all programmes and priorities.

However, the following programmes and priorities shall be excluded from the scope of the suspension:

  

(i)

programmes or priorities which are already subject to a suspension decision adopted in accordance with Article 23(6);

  

(ii)

programmes or priorities whose resources are to be increased as a result of a reprogramming request addressed by the Commission in accordance with Article 23(1) in the year of the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9);

  

(iii)

programmes or priorities whose resources have been increased within the two years preceding the trigger event referred to in Article 23(9) as a result of a decision adopted in accordance with Article 23(5);

  

(iv)

programmes or priorities which are of critical importance to addressing adverse economic or social conditions. Such programmes or priorities shall cover programmes or priorities supporting investments of particular importance to the Union related to the YEI. Programmes or priorities may be considered of such critical importance when they support investments related to the implementation of recommendations addressed to the Member State concerned in the framework of the European Semester and aimed at structural reforms, or related to priorities supporting poverty reduction or to financial instruments for the competitiveness of SMEs.

3.   DETERMINING THE FINAL LEVEL OF SUSPENSION OF COMMITMENTS FOR THE PROGRAMMES FALLING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SUSPENSION

The exclusion of a priority within a programme shall be carried out by reducing the commitment of the programme pro rata to the allocation to the priority.

The level of suspension to be applied to the commitments of the programmes shall be that which is necessary to reach the aggregate level of suspension determined under point 1.

4.   DETERMINING THE SCOPE AND THE LEVEL OF SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS

The programmes and priorities referred to under point 2(i) to (iv) shall also be excluded from the scope of suspension of payments.

The level of suspension to be applied shall not exceed 50 % of the payments of programmes and priorities.

ANNEX VII

ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY

Allocation method for the less developed regions eligible under the Investment for growth and jobs goal, referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2)

  

1.

Each Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible NUTS level 2 regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps:

  

(a)

determination of an absolute amount (in EUR) obtained by multiplying the population of the region concerned by the difference between that region's GDP per capita, measured in PPS, and the EU-27 average GDP per capita (in PPS);

  

(b)

application of a percentage to the above absolute amount in order to determine that region's financial envelope; this percentage shall be graduated to reflect the relative prosperity, measured in PPS, as compared to the EU-27 average, of the Member State in which the eligible region is situated, i.e.:

  

(i)

for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is below 82 % of the EU-27 average: 3,15 %;

  

(ii)

for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is between 82 % and 99 % of the EU-27 average: 2,70 %;

  

(iii)

for regions in Member States whose level of GNI per capita is over 99 % of the EU-27 average: 1,65 %;

  

(c)

to the amount obtained in accordance with point (b) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 1 300 per unemployed person per year, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unemployment rate of all the EU less developed regions applied.

Allocation method for transition regions eligible under the Investment for growth and jobs goal, referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2)

  

2.

Each Member State's allocation shall be the sum of the allocations for its individual eligible NUTS level 2 regions, calculated in accordance with the following steps:

  

(a)

determination of the minimum and maximum theoretical aid intensity for each eligible transition region. The minimum level of support is determined by the average per capita aid intensity per Member State before the application of the regional safety net, allocated to the more developed regions of that Member State. If the Member State has no more developed regions, the minimum level of support will correspond to the initial average per capita aid intensity of all more developed regions, i.e. EUR 19,80 per head and per year. The maximum level of support refers to a theoretical region with a GDP per head of 75 % of the EU-27 average and is calculated using the method defined in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1. Of the amount obtained by this method, 40 % is taken into account;

  

(b)

calculation of initial regional allocations, taking into account regional GDP per capita (in PPS) through a linear interpolation of the region's relative GDP per capita compared to EU-27;

  

(c)

to the amount obtained in accordance with point (b) is added, if applicable, an amount resulting from the allocation of a premium of EUR 1 100 per unemployed person per year, applied to the number of persons unemployed in that region exceeding the number that would be unemployed if the average unemployment rate of all the less developed regions applied.

Allocation method for the more developed regions eligible under the Investment for growth and jobs goal, referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2)

  

3.

The total initial theoretical financial envelope shall be obtained by multiplying an aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 19,80 by the eligible population.

  

4.

The share of each Member State concerned shall be the sum of the shares of its eligible NUTS level 2 regions, which are determined on the basis of the following criteria, weighted as indicated:

  

(a)

total regional population (weighting 25 %);

  

(b)

number of unemployed people in NUTS level 2 regions with an unemployment rate above the average of all more developed regions (weighting 20 %);

  

(c)

employment to be added to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target for regional employment rate (ages 20 to 64) of 75 % (weighting 20 %);

  

(d)

number of persons aged 30 to 34 with tertiary educational attainment to be added to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target of 40 % (weighting 12,5 %);

  

(e)

number of early leavers from education and training (aged 18 to 24) to be subtracted to reach the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth target of 10 % (weighting 12,5 %);

  

(f)

difference between the observed GDP of the region (measured in PPS), and the theoretical regional GDP if the region were to have the same GDP per head as the most prosperous NUTS level 2 region (weighting 7,5 %);

  

(g)

population of NUTS level 3 regions with a population density below 12,5 inhabitants/km2 (weighting 2,5 %).

Allocation method for the Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund under Article 90(3)

  

5.

The total theoretical financial envelope shall be obtained by multiplying the average aid intensity per head and per year of EUR 48 by the eligible population. Each eligible Member State's a priori allocation of this theoretical financial envelope corresponds to a percentage based on its population, surface area and national prosperity, and shall be obtained by applying the following steps:

  

(a)

calculation of the arithmetical average of that Member State's population and surface area shares of the total population and surface area of all the eligible Member States. If, however, a Member State's share of total population exceeds its share of total surface area by a factor of five or more, reflecting an extremely high population density, only the share of total population will be used for this step;

  

(b)

adjustment of the percentage figures so obtained by a coefficient representing one third of the percentage by which that Member State's GNI per capita (measured in purchasing power parities) for the period 2008-2010 exceeds or falls below the average GNI per capita of all the eligible Member States (average expressed as 100 %).

  

6.

In order to reflect the significant needs of Member States, which acceded to the Union on or after 1 May 2004, in terms of transport and environment, their share of the Cohesion Fund will be set at a minimum of one third of their total final financial allocation after capping as defined in paragraphs 10 to 13 received on average over the period.

  

7.

The allocation from the Cohesion Fund for the Member States defined in the second subparagraph of Article 90(3) shall be digressive over seven years. This transitional support will be of EUR 48 per capita in 2014, applied to the total population of the Member State. The amounts in the following years will be expressed as a percentage of the amount defined for 2014, the percentages being 71 % in 2015, 42 % in 2016, 21 % in 2017, 17 % in 2018, 13 % in 2019 and 8 % in 2020.

Allocation method for the European territorial cooperation goal referred to in Article 4 of the ETC Regulation

  

8.

The allocation of resources by Member State, covering cross-border and transnational cooperation, and including the contribution from the ERDF to the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, is determined as the weighted sum of the share of the population of border regions and of the share of the total population of each Member State. The weight is determined by the respective shares of the cross-border and transnational strands. The shares of the cross border and transnational cooperation components are 77,9 % and 22,1 %.

Allocation method of the additional funding for regions referred to in point (e) of Article 92(1)

  

9.

An additional special allocation corresponding to an aid intensity of EUR 30 per inhabitant per year will be allocated to the outermost NUTS level 2 regions and the northern sparsely populated NUTS level 2 regions. That allocation will be distributed per region and Member State in a manner proportional to the total population of those regions.

Maximum level of transfers from funds supporting cohesion

  

10.

In order to contribute to achieving adequate concentration of cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member States and to the reduction of disparities in average per capita aid intensities, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds to each individual Member State will be 2,35 % of the GDP of the Member State. The capping will be applied on an annual basis, subject to adjustments necessary to accommodate the frontloading of the YEI, and will - if applicable - proportionally reduce all transfers (except for the more developed regions and European territorial cooperation goal) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer. For Member States which acceded to the Union before 2013 and whose average real GDP growth 2008-2010 was lower than -1 %, the maximum level of transfer will be 2,59 %.

  

11.

The ceilings referred to in paragraph 10 above include the contributions from the ERDF to the financing of the cross-border strand of the European Neighbourhood Instrument and of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance. Those ceilings do not include the specific allocation of EUR 3 000 000 000 for the YEI.

  

12.

Calculations of GDP by the Commission will be based on the statistics available in May 2012. Individual national growth rates of GDP for 2014 to 2020, as projected by the Commission in May 2012, will be applied for each Member State separately.

  

13.

The rules described in paragraph 10 shall not result in allocations per Member State higher than 110 % of their level in real terms for the 2007-2013 programming period.

Additional provisions

  

14.

For all regions whose GDP per capita (in PPS) was used as an eligibility criterion for the 2007-2013 programming period and was less than 75 % of the EU-25 average, but whose GDP per capita is above 75 % of the EU-27 average, the minimum level of support in 2014-2020 under the Investment for growth and jobs goal will correspond every year to 60 % of their former indicative average annual allocation under the Convergence allocation, calculated by the Commission within the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013.

  

15.

No transition region shall receive less than what it would have received if it had been a more developed region. In order to determine the level of this minimum allocation, the allocation distribution method for more developed regions will be applied to all regions having a GDP per capita of at least 75 % of the EU-27 average.

  

16.

The minimum total allocation from the Funds for a Member State shall correspond to 55 % of its individual 2007-2013 total allocation. The adjustments needed to fulfil this requirement shall be applied proportionally to the allocations from the Funds, excluding the allocations under the European territorial cooperation goal.

  

17.

To address the effects of the economic crisis on Member States within the euro area on their level of prosperity, and in order to boost growth and job creation in these Member States, the Structural Funds will provide the following additional allocations:

  

(a)

EUR 1 375 000 000 for the more developed regions of Greece;

  

(b)

EUR 1 000 000 000 for Portugal, distributed as follows: EUR 450 000 000 for more developed regions, of which EU 150 000 000 for Madeira, EUR 75 000 000 for the transition region and EUR 475 000 000 for the less developed regions;

  

(c)

EUR 100 000 000 for the Border, Midland and Western region of Ireland;

  

(d)

EUR 1 824 000 000 for Spain, of which EUR 500 000 000 for Extremadura, EUR 1 051 000 000 for the transition regions and EUR 273 000 000 for the more developed regions;

  

(e)

EUR 1 500 000 000 for the less developed regions of Italy, out of which EUR 500 000 000 for non-urban areas.

  

18.

In order to recognise the challenges posed by the situation of island Member States and the remoteness of certain parts of the Union, Malta and Cyprus shall receive, after applying the method of calculation referred to in paragraph 16, an additional envelope of EUR 200 000 000 and EUR 150 000 000 respectively under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and distributed as follows: one third for the Cohesion Fund and two thirds for the Structural Funds.

The Spanish regions of Ceuta and Melilla shall be allocated an additional total envelope of EUR 50 000 000 under the Structural Funds.

The outermost region of Mayotte shall be allocated a total envelope of EUR 200 000 000 under the Structural Funds.

  

19.

To facilitate the adjustment of certain regions either to changes in their eligibility status or to the long-lasting effects of recent developments in their economy the following additional allocations are made:

  

(a)

for Belgium EUR 133 000 000, out of which EUR 66 500 000 for Limburg and EUR 66 500 000 for the transition regions of the Region of Wallonia;

  

(b)

for Germany EUR 710 000 000, out of which EUR 510 000 000 for the former Convergence regions in the transition regions' category and EUR 200 000 000 for the Leipzig region;

  

(c)

notwithstanding paragraph 10, the less developed regions of Hungary will be allocated an additional envelope of EUR 1 560 000 000, the less developed regions of the Czech Republic an additional envelope of EUR 900 000 000 and the less developed region of Slovenia an additional envelope of EUR 75 000 000, under the Structural Funds.

  

20.

A total of EUR 150 000 000 will be allocated for the PEACE programme, of which EUR 106 500 000 for the United Kingdom and EUR 43 500 000 for Ireland. That programme will be implemented as a cross-border cooperation programme involving Northern Ireland and Ireland.

Additional adjustments in accordance with Article 92(2)

  

21.

In addition to the amounts set out in Articles 91 and 92, Cyprus shall benefit from an additional allocation of EUR 94 200 000 in 2014 and EUR 92 400 000 in 2015 to be added to its Structural Funds allocation.

(d)

Member States, in which less developed regions cover more than 15 % and less than 65 % of the population, shall also provide to the Commission information on the method used to estimate gross fixed capital formation in those regions. For this purpose, Member States shall use regional level public investment data where available. In the event that such data is not available, or in other duly justified cases, including where a Member State for the period 2014-2020 has significantly changed the regional breakdown as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003, gross fixed capital formation can be estimated by applying regional public expenditure indicators or regional population to national level public investment data.

  

(e)

Once there is agreement by the Commission and the Member State, Table 1 and, where applicable, Table 2 will be included in the Partnership Agreement of the Member State concerned as the reference level of the public or equivalent structural expenditure to be maintained in the years 2014-2020.

2.2   Mid-term verification

  

(a)

At the time of the mid-term verification, a Member State shall be deemed to have maintained the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure if the annual average of expenditure in the years 2014-2017 is equal to or higher than the reference level of expenditure set in the Partnership Agreement.

  

(b)

Following the mid-term verification, the Commission may revise, in consultation with a Member State, the reference level of public or equivalent structural expenditure in the Partnership Agreement if the economic situation of the Member State has significantly changed from that estimated at the time of adoption of the Partnership Agreement.

2.3   Ex post verification

At the time of the ex post verification, a Member State shall be deemed to have maintained the level of public or equivalent structural expenditure if the annual average of expenditure in the years 2014-2020 is equal to or higher than the reference level of expenditure set in the Partnership Agreement.

3.   FINANCIAL CORRECTION RATES FOLLOWING EX POST VERIFICATION

Where the Commission decides to carry out a financial correction in accordance with Article 95(6), the rate of financial correction shall be obtained by subtracting 3 % from the difference between the reference level in the Partnership Agreement and the level achieved, expressed as a percentage of the reference level, and then dividing the result by 10. The financial correction shall be determined by applying that rate of financial correction to the Funds' contribution to the Member State concerned for the less developed regions for the full programming period.

If the difference between the reference level in the Partnership Agreement and the level achieved, expressed as a percentage of the reference level in the Partnership Agreement, is 3 % or less, no financial correction shall be made.

The financial correction shall not exceed 5 % of the Funds' allocation to the Member State concerned for the less developed regions for the full programming period.

Joint Statement by the Council and the Commission on Article 67

The Council and the Commission agree that Article 67 (4) which excludes the application of simplified costs set out in Article 67 (1) (b)-(d) in cases where an operation or a project forming part of an operation is implemented exclusively through public procurement procedures does not preclude the implementation of an operation through public procurement procedures which result in payments by the beneficiary to the contractor based on pre-defined unit costs. The Council and the Commission agree that the costs determined and paid by the beneficiary based on these unit costs established through public procurement procedures shall constitute real costs actually incurred and paid by the beneficiary under Article 67 (1) (a).

* * *

Joint Statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the revision of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council linked with the reconstitution of appropriations

The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agree to include in the revision of the Financial Regulation, aligning Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council to the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-20, provisions necessary for the application of the arrangements for the allocation of the performance reserve and in relation to the implementation of financial instruments under Article 39 (SME initiative) under the Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds concerning the reconstitution of:

  

i.

appropriations which had been committed to programmes in relation to the performance reserve and which had to be decommitted as a result of priorities under these programmes not having attained their milestones and;

  

ii.

appropriations which had been committed in relation to dedicated programmes referred to under Article 39(4)b and which had to be de-committed because the participation of a Member State in the financial instrument had to be discontinued.

* * *

Joint Statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on Article 1

If further justified derogations to the common rules are needed to take into account specificities of the EMFF and of the EAFRD, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission commit to allow for these derogations by proceeding with due diligence to the necessary modifications to Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds.

* * *

Joint Statement by the European Parliament and the Council on the exclusion of any retroactivity with regard to the application of article 5(3)

The European Parliament and the Council agree that:

  

—

concerning the application of Articles 14(2), 15(1)(c), and 26 (2) of Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds, the actions taken by the Member States to involve the partners referred to in Article 5(1) in the preparation of the Partnership Agreement and the programmes referred to in Article 5 (2) include all actions taken on a practical level by the Member States irrespective of their timing as well as actions taken by them before the entry into force of that and before the day of the entry into force of the delegated act for a European code of conduct adopted in accordance with Article 5(3) of the same Regulation, during the preparatory phases of a Member State programming procedure, provided that the objectives of the partnership principle, laid down in that Regulation, are achieved. In this context, Member States, in accordance with their national and regional competences, will decide on the content of both, the proposed Partnership Agreement and proposed draft programmes, in accordance with the relevant provisions of that Regulation and the fund specific rules;

  

—

the delegated act laying down a European code of conduct, adopted in accordance with Article 5(3), will under no circumstances and neither directly nor indirectly have any retroactive effect, especially concerning the approval procedure of the Partnership Agreement and the programmes, since it is not the intention of the EU legislature to confer any powers on the Commission to the effect that it could reject the approval of the Partnership Agreement and programmes solely and exclusively based on any kind of non-compliance with the European code of conduct, adopted in accordance with Article 5(3);

  

—

the European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission to make available for them the draft text of the delegated act to be adopted under article 5(3) as early as possible, but not later than the date when the political agreement on the Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds is adopted by the Council or the date when the draft report on that Regulation is voted at the plenary of the European Parliament, whichever date is the earliest.
